2,Estimation of Buckling Load of Glass Fibre Based Structure Sheet as Single Face,"The corrugated structure sheet have been widely used in manufacturing industries.
Because the corrugated structure have many advantages such as light-weight, high stiffness, cheap.
Generally, the corrugated fiberboard consists of three layers such as, the outside (upper) linear,
inside (lower) linear and a corrugated mediums. It is called as a double face corrugated sheet. In
this work, we focused on a glass fiber based single face corrugated sheet, which is produced by
Kubo Manufacturing Co., Ltd [1]. The glass fiber based single face corrugated structure sheet
(GFSS) is knitted with twisted yarn Nittobo E-glass for making its single face corrugated sheet.
It has a good electromagnetic wave transmission. The compressive strength is using the line force
along the panel lateral direction.
In this research is focus which circle shape of inside or outside of GFSS, varied diameter of
d = 30 , 40 and 50 mm, for results, conditions of Edge of crush circle d = 40 mm outside have
buckling strength higher than their shape.",,,
2,Development of a Low Cost Water-Level Sensor for Paddy Field and Based on Embedded System and IoT,"It is said that water level control is important in rice
farming. However, Controlling water level everyday takes
a lot of time and efforts due to the number of fields each
farmers have. Futhermore, techniques in water level con-
trol requires a lot of exprience in rice farming and it
makes hard situations to people who just started rice
farming. Low cost IoT system that enables to monitor
water level over the internet is in need. In this research,
we have developed waterlevel sensing system using pres-
sure sensor. We are going to evaluate the sensor using
the paddy field IoT system that we propose.","We placed the paddy field IoT system on real paddy
field. We performed 1.5km long distance wireless commu-
nication with using LoRa and uploaded data from paddy
field. We think that by applying correction based on
temperature, we improved the precision upto the point
where it is precise enough for sensing in paddy field.",,
2,"Attempt at a Development of Optimized Sewage Sludge Compost for Button
Mushroom Cultivation","In Japan, approximately 2.29 million tons of sewage sludge is produced annually from
sewage treatment plants, and 63% of the sludge has been reutilized for construction materials.
However, while the organic content accounts for 80% of the total, ? the utilization ratio focusing
on the organic characteristics of sewage sludge is quite low. Therefore, to utilize organic contents
of the sludge, our research group has conducted research on edible mushroom cultivation using
sewage sludge and regional biomass. Until now, we succeeded to cultivate oyster mushrooms and
button mushrooms using sewage sludge compost, and the observed edible mushrooms have
higher amino acids contents and high productivity compared with traditional cultivation methods.
Besides, our previous study suggested that difference of microbial community compositions such
as order Bacillales in the compost affected to the higher productivity of button mushroom.
However, because commercial sewage sludge compost has lower Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio
(6–8), proportion of the sludge compost become lower due to higher C/N ratio (17–20)
requirement of button mushroom medium.
To optimize the sewage sludge compost for button mushroom cultivation, we attempt to
prepare two types of composts under anaerobic condition: 1) modified sludge compost: sewage
sludge, soil improvement materials, and field soil and 2) mixed sludge compost: sewage sludge,
soil improvement materials, field soil, bamboo chips, dried “Shochu” distillery wastes, and rice
bran. Two composts were fermented for three months with 3 times mixing. To compare the
microbial community compositions of two types of composts, we evaluate 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis and agar plate count of general bacteria. In future plan, we will attempt to
cultivate button mushroom using our prepared new composts with higher C/N ratio and compare
the amino acids contents and productivity with traditional and our previous cultivation ways.",,,
2,"Attempt at Elucidation of Parasitic-nematodes Controlling Mechanism of Bacillus
and Non-parasitic Nematodes Predominated Compos","A lotus root has been frequently eaten well as a vegetable in Japan, and yearly produced approximately 59,990 t. In current situation of lotus cultivation, replant problems of lotus such as ‘kokuhi disease’ (arising blacking spot on surface) and ‘yuzuhada disease’ (arising uneven surface like a skin of citrus fruits) are considered problematic because these diseases lead to deterioration of quality and decrease lotus production (e.g. loss of 100 million yen in Tokushima prefecture). It is known that two species of plant parasitic-nematodes named as Hirschmanniella diversa and H. imamuri cause these diseases. However, there is no effective control method for nematode disease. Therefore, we focused on Bacillus and non-parasitic nematodes predominated compost, which is prepared from Bacillus predominated night-soil sludge, cedar bark and dehydrated soil. Previously, it is reported that antibiotics (iturin A and Bt toxin) produced from genus Bacillus can protect plant growth against plant pathogenic microorganisms and nematodes. Also, it is known that non-parasitic nematodes have different feeding characteristics depending on environment, which are relevant to plant productivity and soil fertility. Besides, focusing on the feeding characteristics of the nematodes, we expect predatory nematodes grown in the compost attack parasitic nematodes. Therefore, we considered that disease from parasitic nematodes can be controlled by using Bacillus and non-parasitic nematodes predominated compost. In previous study, the fertilization of the compost at 3 t per 10 a prevented replant problem of potato from parasitic nematodes of Melidogyne incognita.  Our purpose of this study is elucidation of nematodes disease controlling mechanisms using the compost. To achieve our goals, we prepared three types of lotus cultivation planters at same conditions of fertilization with 1) the heat-treated compost, 2) untreated compost, and 3) no compost. By doing so, we can evaluate the effects of Bacillus and non-parasitic nematodes or component of the compost (without organisms) for parasitic nematodes controlling mechanism. In our previous study, growth rate of Bacillus was increased in lotus cultivation soil with the compost, and microbial community structure was different between few diseases occurred lotus field and serious disease occurred fields. Thus, in this study, we investigate growth of general bacteria and Bacillus in soils of three types planters by microbial colony count at two times per month. In addition, we perform 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to compare difference of microbial community structures of soils from three types cultivation tests.",,,
3,R&D of DBD Plasma Reactor for Sterilizing Toothbrush,"Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma has been intensively investigated for biomedical
applications [1-4], such as inactivation of bacteria including antibiotic-resist germs, fungi,
spores and viruses [5-7] and hemostasis [8,9]. In this study, we developed dielectric barrier
discharge (DBD) plasma reactor for inactivating streptococcus mutans and?porphyromonas
gingivalis etc. on toothbrush, which cause dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. DBD is
one of non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma . DBD requires small energy because current is
cut before the transition to arcing from streamer discharge.
In recent years, many bacteria including streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas
gingivalis etc. more survive and proliferate on toothbrush than past decades because of
increasing frequency of use in a day and decreasing the time for dry. It may be possible to
decrease the infection risk of dental caries and periodontitis by sterilizing toothbrush. For this
purpose, DBD plasma reactor was developed. DBD plasma reactor consists of grounded liquid
and high-voltage liquid electrode covered with dielectric material. DBD plasma was generated
in air gas between grounded liquid and dielectric material at room temperature. At present, we
will show the fundamental characteristics of the developed reactor, such as energy consumption
and decomposition-efficiency of indigo carmine, based on which a sterilization effect of the
reactor is expected. ?",,,

Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","Recently, cardiac (heart Muscle) cells be successfully generated from human induced pluripotent stem
cells at high density [1]. However, the effect of seeding density on heart cells generation remains unclear.
We established a protocol to induce cardiomyocytes at super low density to clarity the effects of seeding
density [2]. But the protocol was able to induce only few percent. Here, we optimize Wnt inhibitor
conditions to induce more than 75% of cardiomyocytes.",,,
3,Hydrophilicity Evaluation Using? Rhodamine B of Plasma-Irradiated PDMS,"It is known that hydrophilicity can be evaluated from the contact angle.
However, this method is difficult to know the range and uniformity of hydrophilicity.
Since Rhodamine B is adsorbed on the hydrophobic surface, I considered that evaluation
of hydrophilicity could be made from the fluorescence intensity of the stained Rhodamine B","On going, but Rhodamine B can evaluate hydrophilicity. Moreover,
from the fluorescence intensity, it is possible to know the
hydrophilicity necessary for cell adhesion",,
3,Development of Earthworm Transformation Systems for Novel Research Tools.,"Environmental and health issue are important problems in our society. Soil contamination is a
global concern because it contaminates soil and groundwater. In particular, water contaminated with
harmful substances such as heavy metals have a strong negative influence on the human body, and also
it cannot be used for cultivating agricultural crops. Therefore, simple purification techniques and
monitoring techniques are required for solving these issues. Concerning a health problem, the number
of cancer patients is getting increased in modern society. As innovative medicines for this disease,
biological medicines made from transformed organisms have attracted a lot of attention. However,
biological medicines have some problems such as high-producing cost and difficulty of producing
process.
Our research target, Eisenia fetida and Eisenia andrei has been approved as the model animal of
acute toxicity test by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This
animal has been treated as a widely studied material in the world. In addition, it is known to have a
metallothionein which is a heavy metal binding protein, but its detailed mechanism is still unknown.
Earthworms have also been studied for their therapeutic effects on human diseases such as antipyretic,
diuretic, fibrinolytic agent. We have already developed a dietary supplement using these functions [1].
Furthermore, Kim et al. reported the production method for biomedicine using earthworm, Perionyx
excavates. However, the detail transformation method of it is still unknown [2].
Therefore, earthworms have the potentiality for solving both the environmental and health
problems. However, common transformation systems leading to the drastic development of research
have not been established. Here, we have attempted to develop a transformation method of the
earthworm, but the transformation efficiency was only 16%. Hence, we investigated the optimal
condition of transformation and the egg culture conditions for the development of gene induction
methods into the Earthworm and the egg, respectively.
We succeeded in improving the transformation efficiency to 32% by changing electrode but the
survival rate decreased to 48%. Furthermore, we also succeeded in hatching eggs using a sand medium.
These results can be expected not only to contribute the development for earthworm genetic engineering
technology but to be utilized as a new model animal between the microorganisms to higher animals.

3,"Development of Earthworm Cell Culture Basic Technology as Novel Animal
Host Cells","Biological medicines known as human therapeutic drugs are often produced by Chinese Hamster
Ovary (CHO). However, its production cost is hugely expensive because the process needs anaerobic
conditions. On the other hand, coelomocytes of earthworm, Eisenia fetida, can be cultured under the
aerobic conditions [1]. Therefore, the cost reduction would be expected by this species. In addition, E.
fetida has been approved as the model animal of acute toxicity test by Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD). It has been treated as a wide-spread studied material in the world.
Hence, earthworm cell culture systems are not only beneficial for cost reduction but also various assay
system such as toxicity test. However, there have been few reports of earthworm cell culture systems
and no reports of single cell and subculture methods. Here, we attempted to develop basic methods of
earthworm cell culture system such as long-term cell culture and cell cryopreservation methods. We
attempted to construct the coelomocytes culture system based on the method of Fuller-Espie et al [2].
As a result, we obtained 7.3 ± 1.0 × 10 4 cells/earthworm using liquid nitrogen and 6.2 ± 3.5 × 10 5
cells/earthworm were corrected by an ultrasonic wave method without killing the earthworms. In
addition, we succeeded in the cell culture for 26 days without microorganism contamination using
Hansen S-301 medium.
Currently, we are investigating into a cell preserving system, and single cell culture system using
the organs such as a heart. These results contribute to developing the fundamental cell culture technology
of the earthworm.",,,
3,"Development of Non-task-oriented Dialogue System for Elderly Person Living
Alone","1. Introduction
The number of elderly persons living alone increase year by year. They are lonely, and they
need some supports. Recently, they can speak to another person using the internet. However,
about 70% elderly person over 75 cannot use the internet. Therefore, in order to cope with this
issue, we propose communication system without internet.
2. Non-task-oriented Dialogue System
The proposed system is consisted of speech synthesis, language analysis, dialogue
management, language generation, and speech synthesis.
The system has three features. First, it can work without internet. Second, it provides a lot of
opportunities to speak for elderly person. Third, it can distinguish words with multiple
meanings. The system adopts Word2Vec. It is a group of related models that are used to
produce word embeddings. And, it takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector
space. Also, this can work without internet. The proposed system has functions that generate
responses by multiple modules. Word2Vec cannot understand multiple meaningful words. So,
conventional communication system using Word2Vec may stop conversation. On the other
hand, developed communication system used cos similarity calculation to distinguish words
with multiple meanings. As a result, it is easy to continue conversation.
3. Conclusion
The developed system was able to work without the internet. Furthermore, the system is
evaluated by co-occurrence network. The system has the effect that a lot of words are used in
conversation (Fig1). In other words, it can provide stimulating conversation ? better than
conventional system. Therefore, it is suitable as a talker for elderly person living alone.",,,
3,Study on Environmental Sound Recognition by Machine Learning,"In recent years, Deep Learning technology (DL) attracts attention due to high
performance of computers and popularization of GPUs. In DL, feature extraction is
performed automatically if there is sufficient data, so it became possible to deal
with problems that were difficult with conventional machine learning methods.
This research was inspired by ""smart speaker"" which uses the DL and performs
voice assistant. Currently, smart speakers are intended only for ""human voice"", but
thinking that if this is set to ""all sounds around us,"" various approaches to animals
and objects as well as humans may be possible.
This time, we will use CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which is one of the
DL technologies. By inputting sound data and label data to CNN and letting it
learn, create and evaluate classifiers. First, collect data necessary for creating a
sorting machine. This time, footsteps and conversations, and other noisy sounds
were recorded. For recording, I used a smartphone and my own microphone. Also,
footsteps also used free material. Next, edit the recorded data. Apply noise and
apply various effects to increase the amount of data.
After collecting sufficient data, preprocess the sound data into a form suitable for
CNN input. From the sound data, a spectrogram is obtained for each fixed interval,
and this is converted to a tensor (Fig. 2). In this
example, the interval was converted to a tensor
with 1 second and the interval width of 0.5
seconds, then normalized and labeled.
As a result of learning, the verification accuracy
was 99.0 [%] at the maximum. Therefore, it is
considered that the data prepared this time can
be almost certainly classified.
In this study, we classified two classes of speech data, but in the future we plan to
build a model that can further increase the number of classifications and output
the results in real time.",,,
3,"Change in Thermal Stability of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Caused by
Amino Acid Substitutions","Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is now an essential protein to visualize target proteins
working in vivo environment. With extremely high stability of GFP, it is possible to monitor the
movement of target proteins in the intracellular environment without damaging the cell function.
Substitution of one or more amino acid can changes the nature of GFP, such as colors and
intensities of fluorescence. Various color-changed GFP have been developed from GFP.
Experiments using more than two protein molecules labeled by different colored GFP mutants
can visualize the interaction between those protein molecules in vivo.
In this study, we prepared wild type GFP and an yellow coloredmutant (YFP) and
conducted differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) of those samples. Both are analyzed as

Its amino acid sequence has unique properties; glycine is regularly positioned at every three residues and iminoic acids such as proline and 4(R)-hydroxyproline that is post-translationally modified proline are often found. Collagen has been used in food from long ago, and it is expected as cosmetics and medical materials in recent years. However, the collagen obtained from mammals such as bovine for commercial applications have some risks such as contamination by infection pathogens. Accordingly, it is highly necessary to obtain safe collagen instead of the native collagen. In this study, for the purpose of the gelation of collagen polymer aqueous solutions, the relationship of polymerization conditions and molecular weight of the polymers was investigated.",The Synthetic yield of Boc-method tripeptide was higher than that of Z-method,,

3,"Comparative investigation of brain activity between listening to music and
imagining of music","In the previous study, it was suggested that listening to music could be an effective study break [1]. However, in addition to listening to music in our daily life, we occasionally imagine music. Thus, we assumed that the imagining music might have a relaxing effect. Therefore, we investigate the brain activity between listening to music and imagining of music as the relaxation task after the mental calculation task. We quantitatively evaluated brain activity by the 10 channels cerebral blood flow meter (WOT - 100) under relaxation tasks (that is, listening to music and imaging music) after the mental calculation task that was two-digit addition in 1 min. Three tasks, i.e. ""listening to music"", ""imagining of music"" and ""resting (as control)"" were chosen for the relaxation tasks. Additionally, in order to investigate how accurately music could be imagined, we asked subjects subjective evaluations from 0 to 100 levels using VAS (visual analog scale) after the experiment. Then, we calculated rates of prefrontal inactivity at the relaxation task and the average concentration change degree of Oxy-Hb (Oxygenated hemoglobin) and Deoxy-Hb (Deoxidized hemoglobin). Cerebral blood flow measurement and calculation details are described in reference [1]. As a result, the rates of prefrontal inactivity suggested that there might be no difference between listening to music and imagining of music. Furthermore, the average concentration change degree of Hb suggested that there was no difference between listening to music and imagining of music when the VAS value was high. However, its degree was lower the case of imagining of music than the case of listening to music when the VAS value was low. ","These results indicate to image the music might have the same effects as the listening to the music, if we could accurately image the song. To support this hypothesis, more experiments should be required in the next research. ",,

metacognition from these points is useful for improving education. For instance, difficult for
students to know whether students understand the content of the lesson at school class. However,
detecting Metacognition helps to judge the comprehension of the lesson.

4,Development of an Educational Tool to Show Cosmic Rays in Virtual World,"It is important to visualize cosmic radiation and develop educational tools to make learners
more interested in elementary particle physics and astrophysics. The learners will be able to confirm
interactions of primary cosmic rays and production, transportation, and propagation of the secondary
cosmic rays if the observations are performed at different altitudes (sea level, at mountain level, or in
balloon born experiments). As a representative method to visualize and observe cosmic rays, there is a
cosmic ray observation device by using a cloud chamber or a spark chamber and the devices are very
meaningful tools to recognize the existence of cosmic rays in the living environment. It, however,
takes amount of time to measure fluxes of cosmic rays at each different altitude. The devices have no
direct sensitivity to uncharged particles like gamma rays due to collapse of pi mesons. Besides, it is
impossible to specify the type of charged particles such as protons, electrons, and muons. Therefore,
our purpose of this study was to visualize falling cosmic rays using virtual reality (VR) technology.
The educational tool enables the learners to understand the type and quantity of natural
radiation at different altitude. The tool was composed of virtual reality head mounted display “Oculus
Rift”, the pair of “Oculus Touch” to control the change of a position in the virtual world, and a
Windows PC. The “Unity” was used to implement the virtual world. The tool allows learners to
change the altitude in the virtual space with changing the amount of the flux of cosmic rays based on
scientific measured data [1] . The tool can provide 360 degrees panorama image at various angles of
view for the learners so that learners can understand the differences of flux at each altitude intuitively.
Virtual concrete walls were prepared at sea level in the virtual world to make learners understand the
differences in energy attenuation of charged particles in the concrete walls. As the results, it was
demonstrated that the tool can create the virtual world and it was confirmed that cosmic rays were well
reproduced at both sea level and mountain level.",,,

Therefore we plan improvement of the English ability by increasing opportunities exposed to English
fundamentally.
Therefore, as part of the activities of the National College of Technology, we started studying the
English Extensive Reading Marathon. This activities goal is improving English proficiency.
We adopted SSS (start with simple stories) style English Extensive Reading method which is the
way of English Extensive Reading. In this activity, not only reading a lot of simple English words
and English sentences but also listening with ears while reading with eyes. In addition, I also made
mini-vibrio battle that introduces English intensive reading books that I read themselves in English
lessons in English. We goal for reading 100,000 words in Kosen Gijuku whereas a number of words
learning at a junior high school is 30,000 words.It is not for an examination and is goal for fixation
of practical command of English used in real living environment more. We suggest that we acquire
experience by English that we develop it. We improve English ability such as listening or the
reading continuously to take a shower in English environment by exposing us. This method is
effective for TOEIC L&R results improvement.
This method is the learning method to read a plain English sentence using a children's book of the
English language regions. We follow three principles and perform English many readings. Point1 is
“You don't use a dictionary as the first principle”. Point2 is “If you don't understand the word, you
skip the word”. Point3 is “If you feel your reading book is boring, you finish this book and find
another book”. In this way, we put a habit on a custom to understand English in English.
It is important that I raise reading and English ability such as the listening in the long term.
Therefore it is necessary to continue English extensive readings as future activity.
Along with that, we plan to arrange the opportunity to output English through the interchange with
the foreign students and try to establish English language learning.

frequency in France","For the past 4 years, I have been studying electrical and electronic engineering at The National Institute of Technology, Hakodate College. In addition, I will transfer into the third year of a university next year. I am going to study bioengineering there, but I have not studied it at all yet. Also, even if I do not have any confidence in measurement methods, I am confident in my English ability. Then, our college has a strong connection with IUTs (Institut Universitaire de Technologie) in Northern and Central France. That is why I decided to participate in this internship.  This project is held at Blois city IUT, in France, from August 30th to September 28th this year. The IUTs are part of the university system in France. The IUTs allow the preparation of a twoyear undergraduate technical diploma. After that, students have the option to work, do a one-year professional degree called “Licence Professionnelle”, or further their studies in a university or “ecole” [1]. This project is designed and organized to provide opportunities to do research and to communicate with local students in English. In addition, it offers a chance to learn a different culture and to improve our international communication abilities.  In this project, the short training period aim to create a setup to measure the electrical impedance of thermo-electrical devices. Challenges concern the frequency range and the low resistance values. I anticipate that what I acquire through this project will be useful for my research in the future.  The IUT that I am going to attend for about a month is in Blois. Blois is a city in the center of France. The town has some picturesque streets and building. And what is more, I will stay with a family while attending IUT, so I look forward to enjoying the peaceful atmosphere with the family on weekends. Also, I hope that I learn French culture through this homestay.  At this point, I have not been to France yet, so I will show what I learned through this 1-month internship on October 5th.  ",,,
6,"Evaluation of Biodegradability of Chemical Organic Matters in an Electronic
Wastewater","Today, everywhere in the world will shift to more advanced information society. So, the
electronics industry is very important to move forward with the information society. Represent
products in the electronic industry are semiconductors and TFT liquid crystal displays. In these
manufacturing processes, various chemical organic matters such as Tetra-methyl-ammonium
Hydroxide (TMAH), Mono-ethanol-amine (MEA) and Diethylene Glycol Mono-butyl Ether
(DEGMBE) are used. After these products are produced, these chemical organic matters are
discharged. However, knowledge of biodegradability of each chemical organic matter for the
wastewater treatment is insufficient. This study was evaluated biodegradability of each chemical
organic matter by batch experiment.
In the batch experiment, the specific COD consuming activity was measured. The activated
sludge from a sewage treatment plant in our college was used for this experiment. The experiment
time was set to 1 to 5 days, and the experiment temperature was set to 20 ° C. TMAH, MEA and
DEGMBE was used as the test substrate, and glucose were used as the control. Organic matter
concentration of each test substrate was set to 0.5 g-COD/L. As a result, TMAH as the test substrate
did not be consumed on the experiment time. The specific MEA consuming activity was lower than
the specific glucose consuming activity. The specific DEGMBE consuming activity was as much as
the specific glucose consuming activity.",,,
6,"Anaerobic Treatment of Electronic Industry Wastewater Containing Glycol Ether
Detergent","Biological wastewater treatment can be divided into two processes, an aerobic process and
an anaerobic process. The aerobic activated sludge treatment is installed in some of wastewater
treatment plants in Japan, however that has some disadvantages. There are large energy consumption
for aeration and a large amount of the excess sludge. On the other hand, methane fermentation
treatment as an anaerobic process has great advantages against aerobic activated sludge treatment.
There are no-need aeration, a small amount of the excess sludge and energy recovery from produced
methane.
In recent years, the electronic industry is rapidly growing. In the manufacturing process of
the electronic industry, wastewater with high organic concentration containing glycol ether detergent
is discharged. The main component of this detergent is diethylene glycol mono butyl ether (C 8 H 18 O 3 ).
In this study, the applicable influent concentration of this wastewater for a methane fermentation
treatment was investigated by continuous feeding experiment.
The electronic industry wastewater containing glycol ether detergent was continuously
treated by an UASB (up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket) reactor. This reactor was operated with COD
volumetric loading of 6.0 kg/m 3 /day under 34 ?.Two kinds of wastewater of different COD with
1500 mg/L and 3000 mg/L were prepared. As a result, approximately 90? of COD removal was
achieved under each feeding wastewater. Because of reduction in dilution water for methane
fermentation treatment, the wastewater COD of 3000 mg/L was more appropriate than the wastewater
COD of 1500 mg/L.",,,
6,"Long-term Continuous Feeding Experiment of Electronic Industry Wastewater
Containing Sulfate by UASB Reactor","At present the world has introduced IoT and ICT as an internet technology. So while the

products such as TFT-LCD and semiconductor. TMAH and MEA aren’t easy biodegradable. Sulfate
has influence on biological wastewater treatment. In this study, we investigated the process
performance of electronic industry wastewater treatment by UASB (Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge

was kept at 35 ± 2 ?. Two wastewaters were prepared in different of COD and sulfate concentration.
For one electronic industrial wastewater, COD and sulfate was set to 1500 mg/L and 160mg-S/L.
Other electronic industrial wastewater, COD and sulfate was set to 3000 mg/L and 320 mg-S/L. The
composition ratio of COD of wastewater was TMAH 60 %, MEA 20 % and others 20 %. Under
feeding each wastewater, COD removal were stable approximately 80 % and influent sulfate were
reduced almost perfect with COD volumetric loading of 12 kg/m 3 /day. The wastewater COD of 3000
mg/L was more practical than the wastewater COD of 1500 mg/L since a water for dilution could
decrease.",,,
6,Synthesis of Crosslinked Phthalocyanines with Metal Coordination Ability,"Phthalocyanine (Pc), which consists of a π-electron conjugated structure, is characterized by
a color from blue to green, excellent chemical stability and thermal stability in visible light.
Furthermore, Pc has a planar molecular configuration similar to porphyrin, and can incorporate
various metal ions and substituents. Therefore, it is possible to synthesize different types of
metallic compounds, and various catalytic activities can be expected as electron transfer
catalysts.
[1]
The basic skeleton of Pc has a structure in which the meso positions of the porphyrin rings
are substituted with nitrogen atoms and in which the benzene rings are bonded to the outside of
the pyrrole rings. Usually, Pc has a metal-ion coordinating property only at the center. However,
we created external coordination sites, each of which consist of three nitrogen atoms in the
heterocycle and the meso positions, in order to coordinate metal ions at the outside of Pc. [2] In
addition, by introducing a polar substituent into the side chain of Pc, it can also interact with
other polar molecules.
In this research, based on the results of previous research, we have synthesized new
crosslinked Pcs (Pc1, Pc2, Pc3) by linking two Pc molecules with bridging moieties (pyrazine
or benzene)(Fig. 1). We aimed to develop new crosslinked Pcs having polar molecules

the nitrifying bacteria were change by water temperature. In addition, microorganisms closely related
to genus Lautoropia, which has a denitrification capability was dominated in June sample. It was
suggested that the nitrate was decrease by
these microorganisms in June. Moreover,

is promising [8,9]. In general, the plasma acts as a source of several active agents to cells, bacteria,
and tissues. At the present, the mechanism of the biomedical effects of the plasmas has been
discussed mainly in terms of the reactive species. However, the biological effect of dielectric
heating of medium has not been denied because the intense alternating electric field is applied to
the medium while the streamer propagating, and dielectric heating becomes non-negligible as the
frequency increases.
In this study, Schlieren and shadowgraph techniques are used to visualize the dielectric
heating caused by needle-liquid discharge. Variations in refraction due to density gradients

6,Effect of Copper Concentration on Nitrification in Seawater Condition,"Aquaculture farm has a big role in food industry. There are many aquaculture farms around the world that
provide ingredient to food industry. This type of industry discharge a lot of waste water containing
ammonia. Fish is one of the ammonia sources in aquaculture tank. Ammonia is a by-product of protein
metabolism that was excreted through gill. Due to water exchanging process, large amount of wastewater
containing ammonia were released into the environment from aquaculture sectors. In some case, wastewater
from aquaculture farm are contaminated with disinfectant chemical. These chemicals can harm recirculating
system in aquaculture tank. Besides, water that contain disinfectant cannot be reused or recirculated into
the system. Therefore, a durable recirculating system that can reduce disinfectant in water, water discharge
from water exchanging process and cost of aquaculture farming is required. This research aims to study
inhibition effect from copper on nitrification process which is important process to remove nitrogen in
water. Copper has been used for many years to control algae and fish parasites. It is a one of common
disinfectant chemical. This study uses Down flow hanging sponge (DHS) as a nitrification reactor. Five
laboratory scale DHS reactors were fed with synthetic sea water that were prepared from sodium
chloride(NaCl), ammonium chloride(NH 4 Cl) and Copper sulphate(CuSO 4 ) at various concentration. The
DHS operated as recirculating system with 10 L synthetic sea water. Four copper concentration ranging
from 0.1-1mg/L, 0.5-20 mg/L, 20-80 mg/L and 50-200 mg/L were added. The water sample was collected
every 2 hours within 12 hours. The result of study shows that this system which were added with Cu
concentration ranging from 0.1-1 mg/L have no effects on ammonia removal in the DHS reactor. The DHS
reactor which were added with copper concentration ranging from 0.5-20 mg/L, temporarily inhibits the
effect on ammonia removal and copper concentration over 20 mg/L completely inhibits ammonia removal.",,,

Parvibaculum lavamentivorans DS-1","Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, is an aromatic polymer which provides
structural support to cell walls and makes them impermeable to water. The presence of lignin in
plant cell walls is a major obstacle for production of cellulosic biofuels and bio-chemicals from

by reducing lignin content or altering lignin structure by genetic engineering. In order to create
an engineered lignin which could be easily decomposed, we focus on alkenal double bond
reductase (DBR) acting on coniferaldehyde. The double bond between C α and C β of
coniferaldehyde is important for the formation of polymeric lignin via radical coupling. Since
DBR catalyzes the reduction of the C α -C β double bond of coniferaldehyde, the expression of the
DBR gene in plants is expected to change the chemical structure of lignin. For this purpose, we
found a novel Parvibaculum lavamentivorans DBR gene, the product of which (PlDBR) has
activity toward coniferaldehyde. Here we report the purification of PlDBR and the screening of
crystallization to determine its three-dimensional structure.
The His-tag fused PlDBR gene was expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3). The cells were
harvested and disrupted using a sonicator to obtain cell extract. The resulting cell extract was
applied to a His-Tag column (Ni Sepharose Fast Flow column, GE). The proteins were eluted by
gradient method, and PlDBR was then purified to near homogeneity. The obtained PlDBR was
used for crystallization using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 293 K. Initial

gas-discharge ion sources is limited by the ion flux injecting into electrodes decided by
the thermal diffusion of the source plasma, and the electric potential generated by beam ions in
electrodes. For improving the current density of ion sources, transportation of charged particles by

the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction is low in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. However, platinum is
rare and expensive, therefore alternative catalysts such as carbon materials are in consideration.
Additionally, hydrogen is being considered as a clean energy carrier. One of the methods to produce
hydrogen is the electrolysis of water. However, electrodes for hydrogen generation are either high-cost

three-electrode cell with a scan rate of 10 mVs ?1 . The electrolytic solutions were a 0.1 M aqueous
solution of sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 ) saturated with O 2 , and a 0.1
M aqueous solution of Na 2 SO 4 with the remaining air expelled
by inert gas. Either CPs or platinum on nanocarbon (Pt/C) were
packed into a porous microelectrode (PME, ? = 50 ?m). We
performed electrochemical measurements in the electrolytic
solutions with a potentiostat/galvanostat and a function generator.
Gold (Au), and carbon-fiber microelectrodes, as well as PMEs,

conditions to establish a sterile culture method. A culture system with the AF6 medium was
performed, and cells underwent a color change to orange at pH4. In order to inform
bioprospecting efforts, the 18S rDNA regions were used for phylogenic analysis. DNA was
extracted and primers for PCR were designed for Chlorococcales.sp. As a result, microalgae
used in this study was clarified to Botryococcus. The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of
Botryococcus is still not completely elucidated. Therefore, we focued on enzymes, CrtW and

8,Development of Hydroponics Kit Using IoT for Employment Support,"Hydroponics as a plant factory is strongly attracting attention in Okinawa, because of
its unsusceptible features for natural disasters such as typhoon and pests. Since
agriculture population recently declines, proprietors of a plant factory tend to employ
agricultural inexperienced people including handicapped people. However, it is difficult
to employ different types of diverse people because of their working skills and handicap
characteristic differs. Actually, they have some anxieties about agricultural works. They
often say ""it is hard to make work plan of the day"", ""I want someone to instruct the next
work step by step"". In order to solve the anxieties and improve productivity of
agricultural crops in hydroponics, this paper propose small-scale hydroponics system,
called hydroponics kit, as shown in Figure 1. Our works in the collaborative project are
constructed two parts as followings:
1. To develop the hydroponics kit, we firstly clarify visualization of the tacit
knowledge of hydroponics. Especially, we analyze growth speed of lettuce are
cultivated in several parameters such as light quantity, light color, water
temperature, and fertilizer concentration. Then, optimal parameters to growth of
agriculture crops was find out. Details of hydroponics kit and curios results of
lettuce?growth rate analysis will be reported at the workshop in October.

Nanoparticles Using the Laser Ablation in Solution","It is well known that metal nanoparticle can be easily generated using the laser
ablation process in solution and that the efficiency of such nanoparticle formation is
enhanced by adding surfactants[1]. In this study, we have investigated the influence of
the type and the concentration of surfactant on the efficiencies of the fluorescent organic
nanoparticle formation of 1-chloro-9,10-bis (phenylethynyl) anthracene (hereinafter,
CBPEA) as well as that of 9,10-bis (phenylethynyl) anthracene (hereinafter, BPEA)
using the laser-ablation technique in surfactant solution by measuring the absorption
spectra after the laser-ablation processes.
Fig.1 are results of the absorption spectra of CBEPA nanoparticles formed by
the laser ablation in amphoteric TDDSA surfactants with acidic (pH = 3) and also basic
(pH = 10) conditions. As shown in Figure 1, the generation efficiency of CBPEA
nanoparticles was remarkably increased in the surfactant solution as compared with
laser ablation in water. In addition, when pH of amphoteric surfactant TDDSA solution
was 10, the absorbance of CBEPA drastically increased compared with that obtained at
pH = 3. As for the spectral shape of CBEPA nanoparticles generated by the laser-ablation
processes, it was found that there were
differences between pH = 3 and pH = 10.
That is, for CBEPA nanoparticles the
absorption spectra at pH 3 has two peaks
at 450 nm and 480 nm, whereas
absorption spectra at pH 10 there are
three peaks at 430 nm, 470 nm and 510

The stacked plies of thick paperboard generally consists of several different material properties combined of hard and soft, or fragile and ductile). Therefore, in the process of form-cutting by the use of wedge knife or punch/die tool, the sheared zone of worksheet tends to be inferior in that profile, debonding, string-like dust generation, while the life time of cutting blade tends to be shorten due to the heavy loading. Since the thickness of worksheet is quite larger than that of general purpose packaging, the optimal blade shape and suitable loading condition should be revealed. However, the processing of cut off the extra-thick board is too special to observe in public, there are not almost academic reports on the cutting behavior of extra-thick board and also any fundamental physical properties of extra-thick board. In this work, the fundamental physical properties of a 4.5mm thickness board was investigated to reveal the dissimilar properties of laminated layers, using the uni-axial in-plane tensile testing. Here, appropriate size of testing specimen was firstly investigated. As the result, some physical properties were compared to that of well-known thin paper board. Next, by choosing several blade types and cutting mechanisms, the corresponded features of blade motion and breakage behavior of upper/lower layers of thick board were investigated.

Resource Control Based on Spectrum Suppressed Transmission","In recent years, HTS (High Throughput Satellite) has attracted worldwide attention. Mostly, HTS
equips a high-power communication satellites, multi-beam satellite antennas, and Ka-band. Thus, it
can improve system throughput by using the frequency band for each beam repeatedly with dynamic
high-power allocation. Ground cellular networks, such as 4G and 5G, are strongly desired to respond
to temporary traffic increase, service area expansion where base station’s radio signal cannot reach,
and emergency communication in case of disaster. HTS will be a reasonable solution as the backbone
network for the ground cellular network.
Especially, HTS causes changes in received power (= C) and inter-beam interference power (= I)
depending with multi-beam resource allocation. However, involuntary C / (N+I) decreases system
throughput. Here, N denotes thermal noise power. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel resource
allocation method based on a spectrum compression with adaptive MODCODs for HTS. The proposed

9,Modeling of Human Avoidance Behaviour Manipulating Linear Slider,"In recent years, various human-machine cooperative systems are used in factory
production lines. These systems increase the efficiency of operators' productivity and are
becoming necessary indispensable tools. For development of the cooperative systems a
mathematical model of the operator is required. Conventionally, it has been assumed that human's
dynamic characteristics do not change while a required action is performed. However, in order to
avoid a collision crisis during manipulation, it is often necessary to manipulate differently than
usual (Fig. 1). At that time, because the actual human behavior is different from the mathematical
human model used in designing the cooperative system, not only does the system do not function
well, but also it is worried about disturbing the avoidance operation.
Therefore, this paper proposes a general-purpose human manipulation model which can
express even operations involving avoidance and detour, instead of using one mathematical
human model, by switching several mathematical models. Using position, velocity and force of a
grip obtained by experiments, human manipulation is divided into several partial motions by Kmeans
method. These motions are interpreted as the basic modes in order to express a human
manipulation and each model is described by ARX model. Next, the switching conditions are
successively determined by the SVM. By constructing a closed loop system with the experimental
system and the proposed human model, an avoidance behavior is simulated. The responses of the
simulation and experimental results show that the proposed model has adequate reproducibility
against sudden behavior (Fig.2).",,,

carbon fibers as a reinforcing material, have been known to generally provide excellent specific
strengths and specific rigidities. In recent years, molding technology for CFRTPs of threedimensional

This study aims to establish a damage repairing and nondestructive testing method that can be
applied to CFRTPs of three-dimensional shape by developing conventional studies of the
nondestructive inspection method using an electromagnetic phenomenon.
First, we analyzed the eddy-current density and temperature distribution induced by various coils
in CFRTPs using the finite element method software (COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a) to select the
shape of the coil that is suitable for melting CFRTPs. Second, we manufactured destructive
experiment equipment according to JIS K 7089 and dropped steel balls under various conditions.
Then, we confirmed the surface and inside of CFRTP by eddy current testing and X-ray CT. Third,
we melted a CFRTP with fiber damage by induction heating, using selected coils based on finite
element analysis results, and we overlapped a CFRTP patch and pressed the two using a press
machine. Finally, we nondestructively inspected the repaired CFRTP using eddy current testing.

Pulses","Femtosecond laser direct writing of metal microstructures has attracted attention in micro 3D
printing. To date, microstructures of noble metals such as Au and Ag were fabricated by using nearinfrared
(NIR) femtosecond laser pulse[1]. Finer microstructures beyond the diffraction limit were
formed successfully using the laser pulse-induced multiphoton absorption. However, it is difficult to
use this technique to fabricate Cu microstructures because Cu ions has intense absorption at ~800 nm
wavelength which was the same of NIR femtosecond laser one. In this study, green femtosecond laser
pulses were used for direct writing of Cu2O nanoparticle solutions. First, Cu2O nanoparticle solution
was prepared. Then, green femtosecond laser writing conditions were examined.
Cu2O nanoparticles were synthesized by polyol method [2]. The Cu2O nanoparticles were dispersed
into deionized water 2-propanol and PVP mixed solution. The Cu2O nanoparticle solution was spincoated
on glass substrates to form Cu2O nanoparticle films. After that, the solution film was baked on
a hot plate at 80°C. Direct writing using green femtosecond laser was performed in air. Wavelength,
pulse duration, and repetition rate of the laser were 515 nm, 100 fs, and 40 MHz, respectively. The
laser pulses were focused onto the samples using an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.90.
Figure 1 shows a FE-SEM image of the synthesized Cu2O nanoparticles. Monodispersed Cu2O
spheres with the diameter of ~800 nm were successfully prepared. The threshold power of the
femtosecond laser direct writing was 2.7 mW at writing speed of 300 μm/s. The microstructure was

9,Reduction of Nonlinear Friction for Motor Drive by Friction Compensation,"This paper reports on the results of investigating previous research on friction compensation in motor drive and clarifies the position of this research. Mechatronics systems (ex. a machine tool) require more high-speed and high-accuracy positioning control to improve productivity. It is known that the friction caused by gears, oil-seals and ball-bearing mechanisms is nonlinear and causes the degradation of positioning accuracy for the system. The influence of these frictions different depending on occurred elements, rotational direction of motor shaft and drive situation such as a high or low rotational speed. Therefore, it is difficult to compensate by one method for various situation and it is desirable to correspond appropriate methods for each cause of occurrence and situation. In this research, we expose the friction characteristics of oil seals and/or gears and propose a new friction model for compensation that can properly express nonlinear characteristics for each element.

Power semiconductor production and a technique are indispensable for electricity conversion and control.
Therefore, our Sustainable Development Goals is the generation technology of the aluminum multi-charged ion and

We generate a multi-charged ion using Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source. As the results of last
year, we improved ion beam by having lowered the pressure in the ECR ion source. The result is shown in the
figure 1. In addition, the experimental parameter of this time optimizes to Ar 4+ . We were able to detect an ion of
Ar 7+ from this result. The quantity of ion beam current was approximately 130nA. The ionization energies of Ar 7+
and Ar 4+ are nearly (Ar 7+ : about 124 eV , Al 4+ : about 120 eV). Therefore, it is theoretically possible to generate Al 4+
by detecting Ar 7+ .
A purpose of this study is to check the optimum in the generation of the argon multi-charged ion. In addition, we
inspect the ionization about the influence of the mirror magnetic field and the optimization etc. Since the specular

For this reason, there are many defects found in a non-destructive inspection of bridges at the areas of stress concentration

The purpose of this study is to develop an inspection method which can visualize stress inside the material and conduct the
test simply.","The mechanoluminescence materials showed luminescence on the stress concentration point. In addition, it was found that the

Using the PiezoelectricActuator","It is important to control the growth of fatigue cracks for a long time. These cracks are usually occurred from the stress concentration at the corner and the heat stress area by the
welding heat and so on. And these are growing due to the vibration. When a crack length reaches the limit, it is called an unstable fracture state. Then, it cannot be controlled.
The aims of this study are to relax the stress of stress concentrated part and to prolong crack growth. As a basic research, we confirm to give local force using the piezoelectric
actuator. The results of the experiments show that it was able to give local force using the piezoelectric actuator. Also, larger compressive force was obtained by sticking in a
straight line rather than tilting and pasting when sandwiching and applying the piezoelectric actuator","From experimental results, test pieces are compressed at all angle θ when fixed on
both ends (Fix) and compression works greatly in θ=90[deg] (horizontal direction).
This is because test pieces are deformed as shown in Fig. 7 (a). This is because the
grip part is pulling test pieces and compressed in the gauge part. Also, test pieces
are pulled in θ=90[deg] (horizontal direction) when freed on both ends(free). This is
because test pieces are deformed as shown in Fig. 7 (b) and compressed in the gauge
part. Larger compressive force was obtained by sticking in a straight line rather than
tilting and pasting when sandwiching and applying the piezoelectric actuator in both
because test pieces are greatly displaced in the direction of the strain gauge 0 [deg]

tires and slipping cars and finally would make service life of roads end unless they are repaired.
Therefore, it is important to appropriately maintain and manage them so that road traffic safety
and driving comfort are preserved. In particular, cracks become a risk factor to cause potholes
and ruts. However, pavement inspection for cracks is still manually carried out, and
measurement vehicles with multiple sensors are impractical because of their expensiveness.
Hence, new systems to inspect pavement which are reasonable and reduce workload are
required and a variety of crack detection methods using pavement images have been widely
researched so far. Spectral clustering is one of them and an effective method. However, that
suffers from processing time due to the large amount of calculation. Among them, calculating
Laplacian-matrix and the eigenvalues especially affect processing time.
In this paper, we propose two methods. One is new method for applying sparse processing for
Laplacian-matrix. This method reduces the processing time and improves accuracy. The other
method doesn't need solve the eigenvalues by considering graph connectivity. Therefore, this
method significantly reduces the processing time, and can estimate potential cracks because this

9,Development of Cylindrical Film Stretching Rheometer,"Elongation viscosity is a fundamental physical property that characterizes the resistance
to elongational deformation of objects. Elongational deformation can be classified into three
types: uniaxial, biaxial, and planer elongation. Elongational viscosity in all elongational
deformations are essential flow characteristics in understanding polymer processing. Uniaxial
elongation deformation is a deformation that stretches rod-shaped material in one direction and
is used for polymer spinning process. Biaxial stretching and plane stretching are deformation
modes in which the material is stretched to form a thin film, which is important in film forming
of polymers, blow molding, and coating of paints. For the rheometer for measuring uniaxial
elongational viscosity, filament stretching type and capillary break-up type elongational
rheometer has become standard measurement methods[1]. On the other hand, many rheometers
have been proposed to evaluate planar elongational viscosity[2]. However, none of them is a
standard measurement method for mobile fluids.
In this research, we propose a method for measuring the plane elongational viscosity
with simplicity and versatility. In this method, a test fluid is filled between two ring-shaped disks,
and a cylindrical film is formed between the two flat plates by separating these disks. The fluid is
received planar elongation deformation at this time and we measure the force acting on the ring

thickness of 5 mm was prepared as a workpiece. TiSiC 2 ceramics were produced by the spark
plasma sintering method. TiSiC 2 ceramics was machined by wire electric discharge machining
and the influence of the servo voltage on machining characteristics was investigated. The removal
rate and surface roughness are shown in Fig. 1. In the case of the servo voltage was low, the
removal rate was increased. And the surface roughness was indicated constant. The removal rate
was lower than that of steel. It is thought that it is caused by high thermal conductivity or melting
point. The optical microscope image of the WEDMed surface is shown in Fig. 2. The crater caused
by discharge was not observed on the WEDMed surface. The removal mechanism is considered
different from metal.",,,
9,"Relationship Between Step Number and Characteristic Information in Gait
Vibration Data","In this study, the information about the gait motion of the human is considered. The
information contains personal characteristics, body type and habit. It is presumed that the
personal characteristics information reflected the gait vibration data on floor. Gait vibration data
are acquired, and one step, two steps and four steps patterns are extracted from the data. The
Adaboost method is applied to pattern extraction from gait vibration data[1]. Moreover, the
personal characteristics information is analyzed from the step pattern, and the possibility of
personal identification is examined. The  Principal Component Analysis is used to the
characteristics evaluation of pattern for the personal identification. The purpose of this research
is to investigate the relationship between step number and characteristic information in vibration
data. The gait vibration is obtained as data by the vibrometer that is installed on the floor. The
vibration data acquired by the vibrometer is analyzed using the PC. Although x-y-z direction
acceleration sensors in the vibrometer is built-in, the z direction as the vertical direction
component is only used.? One step, two steps, and four steps pattern from the continuous
vibration data is found, and is extracted. We call ‘Step’ for the one step pattern. ‘2step’ and
‘4step’ for the continuous two steps and four steps pattern. Classifiers for extracting ‘Step’,
‘2step’, and ‘4step’ are constructed using the Adaboost method with learning samples.? Next,
the personal characteristic observed in ‘Step’, ‘2step’, and ‘4step’ is evaluated. The Principal
Component Analysis: PCA is used for the evaluation.
In all case, the extraction rate and the identification accuracy are improved by the
increasing the number of steps. It turns out that the characteristic of an individual clearly
appears as the number of steps increases. To further improve the step pattern extraction rate by
Adaboost method and personal identification accuracy by PCA is a future task.",,,

COD·L -1 solid organics. The study used ABR with 60 L volume operated with 20 days’ hydraulic
retention time (HRT) in 35°C room. During the 400 days’ operation, ABR could reach total and
soluble COD removal around 98% and 91% removal efficiency respectively while the average
residual total and soluble COD were about 3.2 g-COD·L -1 and 1.3 g-COD·L -1 respectively.
Meanwhile, the organic solid removal efficiency achieved around 90% of TSS and 90% of VSS
removed with the solid effluent concentration at the end of the process about 1 g-TSS·L -1 and 0.9
g-VSS·L -1 respectively. It could achieve the high organic removal performance due to the benefit
of ABR's compartmentalization. The most of the lipid and solid content of this wastewater
removed in the initial compartments which identified as yellowish semi-solid accumulation.
However, the reactor could still run without any troubles and any additional procedures. The study
also examined the availability of microbial community such as Syntrophobacter sulfatireducens

Structure","Millimeter-wave technology is attracted attention as next-generation infrastructure technology for
the safety and security of society. Millimeter-wave technology has been applied to the automotive
radar and full-body scanner. However, mechanical scanning of the millimeter wave has a problem with
cost and space. It is well known that quasi-optical devices such as reflectors and lenses are used in
radiating systems on the basis of ray optics at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies because of
their relatively short wavelength. Generally, the lens antennas are composed of a homogeneous
dielectric material or metallic elements. Considering modulation effects, nematic liquid crystal (LC)
materials with relatively large dielectric anisotropy in the
microwave and millimeter-wave region are attractive in
applications to millimeter-wave devices.

Associated with the Barrage Water","The Kakogawa River which has a catchment area of 1,730km 2 and a length of 96.0km, flows through Hyogo
Prefecture in Japan. The influence of runoff due to barrage water and the Mino River tributary, combined with
a meander in the river upstream from the large barrage on the Kakogawa River (Kakogawa Barrage), has
promoted the development of a sand bar on the river bank opposite the confluence. The sand bar, which has
enlarged and become fixed, currently deflects the passage of water back to the left bank and has decreased the
usable water surface area of the river. To wash away the sandbar, the groin was installed in 2015. The purpose
of this study was to survey the river topography in the vicinity of the Mino River confluence and identify the
factors responsible for sand bar development by using model experiments and numerical analysis. In addition,
the function of the groin and survey of the effects caused by changing the characteristics of the groin were
verified. The hydraulic experiments were carried out in an 8m long, 0.8m width, and 0.4m depth rectangular
main channel under the movable bed condition, in which a 0.48m width tributary channel joined in a right angle
at 4.33m downstream from the upstream of main channel. Movable-bed modeling of the channels at the tributary
junction was performed to assess the influence of the barrage water and the river meander upstream on river
flow, and to observe the flow and the change of elevation characteristics at the junction and their influence on
river topography. The numerical calculations were analyzed using the two-dimensional flow analysis software,

lower rigidity, so carbon fiber reinforced filament is developed to improve mechanical properties of 3D
printing products. On the other hand, from viewpoints of economy and ecology, filament-reproduction
attracts much attention. If the reproduction becomes common sense, it leads to reduction of petroleum
consumption, resulting in preservation of the global environment. To obtain reliable 3D printing products, it
is necessary to know degradation characteristics of reproduced filaments. In this study, degradation
characteristics of PLA and CFRP filaments due to filament-reproduction are investigated. To generate
reproduced filaments, filament reproduction equipment is used, as shown Fig.1. Tensile tests both of PLA
and CFRP filaments are carried out to evaluate effect of the number of reproduction, and microscope

Microalgae","Microalgae are expected for use in various ways such as agriculture, food, pharmaceuticals, environmental cleanup and biofuels. Microalgae used in this study are Chlorella like symbiotic algae isolated from protozoa Paramecium bursaria. The algae have unique characteristics to release their photosynthetic products and to use ammonium ion as nutrient, having possibilities of contribution to carbohydrate production and water treatment. However, many microalgae are not easy to handle because they are too small. To improve unhandiness of microalgae in size, we previously suggested an inclusion of microalgae in an alginate gel. The alginate gel remains insufficient for practical uses in chemical strength.
To improve an alginate gel in chemical strength, this study carried out chemical coating of the gel using cellulose extracted from bagasse. The presence of cellulose coating on an alginate gel was evaluated using FT-IR with ATR method and stereomicroscopy. Furthermore, the chemical properties of the cellulose-coated gel were observed in chemical durability. Although cellulose coating to an alginate gel became successful, degradation of alginate gel after cellulose coating was occurred by some coating approaches but not done by other approaches. From treatment of the alginate gel with some cation species, it was discussed why an alginate gel is degraded.","Successfully cellulose coating of an alginate capsule improved the endurance time of the algal capsule. When cellulose coating was made in water, the internal alginic acid gel was decomposed. → Ca2+ crosslinking the alginate molecules were substituted for monovalent ions like Lit. The best gelling agent is CaCl2 solution. Ca2+ from CaCl2 prevents Lit, which is contained in cellulose solution, from switching places with Ca2+ crosslinking alginate molecules.",,

Education in Radiation Protection","The safety management of the resulting radioactive waste, particularly vitrified high-level
radioactive waste (HLW) has been a major concern. The geological disposal method is internationally
recognized as a common concept for HLW isolation by using natural capability of confining material
in deep geological formations. The knowledge about HLW and geological disposal is essential to the
spread of geological disposal. It is also important for workers in facilities of HLW to learn the safe
management of HLWs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop an educational tool to
support education in radiation protection from HLWs. The tool requires a device in a mock personal
dosimeter, HLW model and the model of shielding materials. The device has a distance sensor and
displays the difference in radiation dose of a HLW with distance and the shielding materials. It was
calculated to acquire the radiation field around a HLW by using a simulation software PHITS[1] and
the input data was based on a Sawamura’ report[2].
As a result, the calculation by PHITS was approximately similar to calculation results by
other two simulation software MCNP and McBend. It was confirmed that a calculation by PHITS was
proper to simulate the environment around HLWs. It was also compared the difference in radiation
dose by the difference in the height of the concrete ceiling. It was confirmed that there is a correlation
between the radiation dose and the height of the ceiling. In consideration of a working space and a
radiation dose, the calculation system with a ceiling height of 300 cm is reasonable. In the future, we
should calculate radiation dose when there are some shielding materials. We will also develop a device
to display dose rate at any positions in the working area.",,,

Slags.","Steelmaking slags are by products of steel making process. Almost all of them are reused. But
now, recycle methods is demanded because of the other contending materials. Slags contais various kinds
of elements. The one of application example is to replant near the coast. Before seaweeds grow in the sea,
biofilm is expected to form on the slags. However, there are few studies that focus on slag-covering
biofilm formation or its effects in the sea. Our study’s purpose is to research how biofilm forms on
steelmaking slags and how it affects growing seaweeds and dissolution process of slags’ composition.
And finally, bring out the steel making slags’ ability as restorative materials as much as possible. To
research how well biofilm forms, quantitation method must be established.
In this research, two barometers which is seemed to be proportional to the quantity of biofilm
formed on the slags were focused on. First, the main energy carrier molecule of all living cells, ATP and
its converted forms, ADP were picked up. The three kinds of molecules are determined their quantity by
A3 method. Second, we focus on that both biofilm and exhaled EPS contains organic carbon. So, the
amount of TOC (Total Organic Carbon) should be depend on the quantity of biofilm. The quantitation
procedure is shown following. At first, pre-treatment slag (slag 5-2) and BOF slag (slag F) are set in LBR
(Laboratory Biofilm Reactor). and artificial sea water (marine art SF, Fujita pharmaceutical, 3% salinity)
was circulated through the slags integrating bacteria floating in the air by a fan. Taking a couple week,
biofilm formed on the slags. Then Biofilm formed in the slags was debonded and suspended into 20ml of
water in centrifuge tubes using vortex mixer. The cell wall of suspended biofilm was crashed by a
sonicator. After centrifuging the suspension, about 15ml of supernatant in the centrifuge tube was
analyzed with TOC measurement. Calibration curve which was used for TOC measurement was created
using potassium biphthalate. And quantity of lights relating ATP, ADP and AMP in remaining
supernatant (about 5ml) was measured using Lumitester (PD-30, Kikkoman Biochemifa Company).",,,

heavy rain often occurred in the summer, sediment-related disasters, floods,
lightning strikes, tornadoes, etc. can cause serious damage. For rainfall,
countermeasures such as setting a reservoir tank under the basement are being
done, but it is often overflowing due to rainfall more than expected.
Based on these facts, in this research, we tried a
prototype system to predict the timing of rainfall.
In this study, image processing was carried out
using a convolution neural network (hereinafter
abbreviated as CNN).
In doing research this time, we used Tensorflow made by Google for framework
and Python 3.5 as language. Also, when performing image processing, a high-
performance GPU is required. Table 1 summarizes these items. This learning
program converges at the value of 0.869823, and the schedule of 100 times is
stopped halfway. The reason the program stopped is considered to prevent over
learning. If excessive learning occurs, the versatility of the model is lost, and the
correct rate decreases for an arbitrary image. The value of 87 [%] is never a high
value, and the quality of the image classification and the program content of the
image processing can be cited as factors that have become this numerical value.
In this research, we made prototype rainfall prediction system. However, at
present it is not possible to judge arbitrary images, and also in image processing,
malfunction is considered, and many problems remain. In the future, as measures
to improve and improve, add a system that can answer arbitrarily input images,
adjust the convolution layer and pooling layer, improve model accuracy, look for
ways to learn from different approaches.

Decomposition","In this research, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based parameterization
approach is utilized to realize efficient multi-objective aerodynamic shape optimizations. The
developed approach is applied to the three dimensional wing shape optimization problem of a
supersonic transport (SST) configuration. Aerodynamic/sonic boom evaluations are performed to
minimize drag coefficient as well as sonic boom strength in this research.
In aerodynamic shape optimization problems, an efficient shape parameterization is
required for reducing the number of design variables, which will result in the reduction of the
number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations. In this research, we will apply a
POD-based parameterization method to a wing shape optimization problem of a SST
configuration. The efficiency of the proposed approach had been approved in the previous study
of multi-objective shape optimization problems of a two dimensional airfoil [1]. Based on the
previous experience, the efficiency of POD method was sufficient and it can reduce the number
of design variables by extracting dominant shape deformation modes from the database of
promising airfoil shapes. One of the purposes of the present research is to investigate the
applicability of the method to three dimensional shape optimization problems.
The SST of Concorde has retired from its commercial flight due to its insufficient
aerodynamic performance as well as its sonic boom problem. The sonic boom is an inherent
problem of supersonic cruising, which is generated by the propagation of strong shock waves to

15,Simple Method for Callus Induction in Flowering Dogwood,"Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a
popular flower tree that is used as roadside trees
and as garden trees. Every season, flowering
dogwood appears its different beauties such as
flowers, fresh spring greenery,
red fruits, and autumn leaves.
In the plant tissue culture technique, callus can be obtained by
culturing fragments of plants tissues, and the whole plant can be
regenerated from the callus by redifferentiaton induced by exogenous
plant hormons. This technique is effective also for plant breeding in
flowering dogwood. However, the previously reported method [1] for
callus induction has some difficulty in operability to put embryos out
of endocarp without injury.
Therefore, in this study, the simple method for callus induction is
established by using leaves as materials instead of seeds of flowering
dogwood.",,,
15,"Clonal Growth and DNA Methylation of a Clonal Shrub, Ardisia Japonica.","Clonal plants are a predominant life form in many vegetation and the clonal plant species are believed to
have survived great climate change in the past.A genetical individual (genet) of clonal plants are composed
of physiological individuals (ramets) connected by a connection such as a rhizome. While each ramet of a
clonal plant is genetically identical, it survives and grows in spatially and temporally different environments.
Epigenetics, which is a long-lasting changes in traits without any changes in DNA sequence, may have an
important role in the growth of clonal plants. Therefore, we are studying the clonal growth and epigenetics of
the clonal plant, Ardisia japonica, a dwarf evergreen shrub commonly found in the evergreen forests and
deciduous forests in Japan.
We set the study site in the deciduous secondary forest dominate by Quercus serrata　and Castanea
crenata. As a first step to analyze the clonal growth of A. japonica, we examine genotype of each ramets by
AFLP (Amplified fragments length polyphorphism) method. The genomic DNA extracted from each ramet’s
leaves were digested with restriction enzymes, ligated with adapter and amplified by PCR, and amplified
fragments were detected by silver staining after SDS-PAGE.With amplification with a pair of primers, we
found that there were at least 5 genets which contain several ramets in the 1 x 1 m2 plot in the study site. The
genetic distance of adjacent genets is large, probably because of the seed spreading by birds.
DNA methylation is a major molecular mechanism of epigenetics and has been suggested to be involved
in adaptation and assimilation of wild plants to environments. The CG and CHG methylation in genomic
DNA in A. japonica was analyzed by modified AFLP using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (MS-
AFLP). The MS-AFLP in ramets of a genet showed that there were polymorphism of DNA methylation in a
genet and changes of methylation or demethylation during clonal growth.",,,
15,"Construction of the Multi-purpose Food Waste Recycling System on Jew’s Ear
Mushroom Cultivation Using Fermented Bagasse and Sugar Shochu Lees","Brown sugar shochu is an alcoholic spirit produced in the Amami Islands
in southern Japan. During the shochu producing process, over 10,000
t/year of waste lees have been discharged, which contains high
potassum concentration (5,200 mg/g-dry).Because the lees are generally
fertilized on local sugarcane fields, potassium accumulation in the soils
are frequently occurred. In addition to the lees, bagasse fibers that
produced from sugarcane production (100,000 t/year) have been
utilized as fuel. Therefore, in order to effectively use the biomass
resources in the island, this study attempted to construct the cascading
circulation system for the industries in Amami through the mushroom
cultivation.
In this laboratory, focusing on assimilating a large amount of potassium
in the process of mushrooms' entity formation, succeeded in cultivating
cloud ear mushroom suitable for the southern climate with fermented
bagasse and brown suger shochu lees.","1) Bagasse and brown sugar shochu lees can be used as the base
material and nutrient supplement for Jew’s ear mushroom
production. In particular, we have shown that brown sugar shochu
lees can increase yields when compared with rice bran as
the nutrient supplement.
2) The fiber contents in mushrooms grown in media containing
fermented bagasse and brown sugar shochu lees are greater than
those of mushrooms grown in other media. Additionally,
the β-glucan contents of these mushrooms are higher. Our result
suggest that mushrooms grown in such media could serve as
a high value-added local product in the Amami Islands.
3) The Jew’s ear mushrooms resolved the potassium levels by 30% in
the media containing fermented bagasse and brown sugar shochu
lees. This is a potential solution to the high potassium problem
caused by sprinkling the lees on local soils.",,
15,"A Comparison of Surface Sterilization Methods for Explants in Propagation of
Glyzyrrhiza uralensis FISCH. (LICORICE) IN VITRO","Micropropagation is widely accepted today as a means of achieving mass production of plants of
economic importance. Effective surface sterilization of explants prior to inoculation is an inevitable
determinant of successful micropropagation. The present study aimed at comparing the efficacy of two new
industrial surface sterilizing agents (Nanopure™ and Sirvip™) with Sodium hypochlorite, one of the most
common sterilizing agents, in propagation of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Licorice) in vitro. Nanopure™
is a colloidal solution of Silver nanoparticles and Sirvip™ is a composition of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal
agents. Nodal explants were categorized based on their position along the length of the stem; distal
(containing first and second nodal positions); middle (containing third to fifth nodal positions) and basal
(containing the last two nodal positions). Explants were inoculated on ½ MS (Murashig and Skoog) media
supplemented with 0.1mg/l IAA and 0.3mg/l BA. Distal explants gave higher survival percentages under
all three treatment types, i.e. 100%, 83%, and 67% respectively under Nanopure, Sirvip and NaOCl, in a
four – week time. In contrast, lower percentages were observed for basal explants, i.e. 17%, 0%, and 17%.
Middle explants’ survival percentages were obtained as 100%, 50%, and 63%. These results could be
attributed to the fact that the distal part of the seedling are lesser contaminated with microorganisms and
the basal part are contacted with soil and thereby heavily contaminated with microorganisms. Overall
survival rates at a four – week time under the treatment types, Nanopure, Sirvip and NaOCl were 74%, 45%
and 50%. The results confirmed that Nanopure is significantly effective than the other industrial surface
sterilizing agent or NaOCl. Therefore, it can be concluded that silver nanoparticles are an effective surface
sterilizer for G. uralensis nodal explants, for propagation in vitro.",,,
17,"Uncultured OD1 Bacteria Forms Biofilm in A/O-MBR under Starvation
Conditions?","Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is one of the most important technology for wastewater
treatment in the world. This system has potential for achieving SDGs No.6 through high
nutrient removal in the wastewater. However, MBR has fouling problem, which induces
membrane clogging and decreasing permeation flux. A lot of researchers focus on the issue
and we should consider to the issue from various perspectives. Thus, our studies also should
be cooperated with the researchers majoring various field, and this cooperation will lead to
solve the SDG No. 17. One of the main causes of fouling is derived from accumulations of
microorganisms and their microbial products on the membrane surface. In the current study,
some bacteria belonging to Betaproteobacteria has been reported as a pioneer of the fouling
(Chen et al., 2015). Attachment and growth of pioneer bacteria on the membrane surface
started to form the biofilm might cause severe fouling. In addition, some studies were
reported that the bacteria belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria plays an
important role in biofilm formation (Miura et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2012). However,
relationship between fouling development and bacterial species in the biofilm was not clear.
In this study, in order to elucidate the biofilm forming bacteria, the two anoxic/oxic (A/O) -
MBRs were operated, and to induce fouling development, the reactor changed to starvation
conditions (0.002 kg-COD·m -3 ·day -1 ).
After each MBR achieved stable operational condition, the reactors were started to operate
under low OLR condition. The progression of fouling in each reactor was evaluated by
monitoring the increase of TMP and the decrease of flux. Microbial samples from AS, MS
and BF were taken in before and after fouling development.
After operating 14 days under starvation conditions, membrane fouling was occurred and
biofilm was developed on the fouled membrane surface. Microbial samples were collected
from BF on the surface and AS. Then the microbial community structures of the samples was
analysed using MiSeq sequencer. The community of BF was completely different with AS at
phylum level. Especially, uncultured bacterial phylum OD1 and TM6 were dominantly
detected in the BF of fouled membrane surface. These results suggested that the specific
bacteria grown in the BF might be important for biofilm formation. Thus, we observed
immobilized microbial samples by using in-situ hybridization chain reaction focused on OD1
phylum. Although OD1 could not be observed in the AS, the phylum existed in the BF. These
results also suggested the OD1 phylum plays an important role in BF.
In conclusion, microbial community compositions between bulk AS and BF were
considerably different, and characteristic bacteria found in BF thought to important for
biofilm formation on the membrane surface in A/O-MBR.",,,

LDV has contributed for monitoring of blood flow imaging system. However, conventional LDV is only one-point measurement. In order to observe the condition of a blood vessel, the previously developed linear multipoint LDV (L-MLDV) system can realize velocity distribution in measurement line. Thus, the blood vessel in a living mouse was imaged by sccaning laser light. In this report, we subsequently developed a Cross sectional multipoint LDV system (CS-MLDV). The CS-MLDV can measure the instantaneous two-dimensional (2D) flow velocity by upgrading the optical components and signal processing from L-MLDV. Instantaneous 2D velocity distribution can be obtained both of the case of flowing blood and distilled water in order to the CS-MLDV has both of high-spatial and high-time resolution.

3,NEUROFEEDBACK TRAINING FOR ENIRS-BASED BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that translates brain The We investigated changes in brain activation patterns using the laterality index (LI), which indicates which side of the brain is more activated (left or right, front or back). We observed an increase in LI magnitude over time during task intervals (Fig. 2), showing an improved spatial control of brain activity. Thus, this approach may be valuable to teach users how to control their own brain signals, and therefore, a BCI. Further work will focus on increasing the number of subjects and evaluating classification performance. objective of this work is to investigate changes in brain activation patterns after neurofeedback training. We aim to improve BCI classification accuracy by helping users learn to control brain activity over the motor cortex area. We measured brain activity with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), where it is estimated by the levels of oxygenated hemoglobin in the cortex. We asked users to activate the left, right, anterior and posterior sides of their motor cortex. Thus far, two healthy male subjects participated in the experiment, which lasted for 3 consecutive days. In each day, 60 trials were held after a 5-minute free training session. The neurofeedback consisted of displaying brain activity information in real time, with visual and auditory indicators (Fig. 1). activity signals into commands to interact with the external world. BCIs can greatly benefit people suffering from motor disabilities, allowing them to do simple tasks using their thoughts alone. Among other uses, BCIs have been used for answering yes/no questions, typing text and controlling wheelchairs. BCIs use machine learning to find patterns in brain activity data. With neurofeedback training, users can learn how to control their brain activity, and by providing consistent data to the BCI, effective classification and translation of these brain activity patterns is possible.",,,
3,Effects of thalidomide toxicity on the development ofhuman embryos using human iPSCS,"Until the 1960s, thalidomide was taken by pregnant women worldwide to prevent morning sickness. However, it was withdrawn from the market because of its strong teratogenicity. Today, thalidomide is back in focus because of its curative effect on certain intractable diseases. However, its mechanism of teratogenicity is still not fully understood because thalidomide toxicity is not apparent in rodents. Therefore, an alternative method to detect its toxicity in the human fetus needs to be established for the safe use of the drug. Consequently, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to study the effect of thalidomide on human embryos.","We succeeded in detecting thalidomide toxicity and found that thalidomide resistance differs between the stages of cell development.

3,STUDY OF MICROGEL PREPARATION FROM CRAB SHELL WASTE BY EMULSIFICATION METHOD,"Red snow crabs have widely distributed and become famous food in Japan. Their shell waste is one of the main sources of chitin and its derivatives. Chitin possesses biocompatible and biodegradable properties, for example, which are beneficial for medical applications such as drug carrier and tissue engineering scaffold. Therefore, this study aims to extract chitin from red snow crab shell waste and prepare microgels from the extracted chitin. Red snow crab shells from Teradomari, Niigata, Japan were removed the impurities such as calcium and proteins by using acid and base hydrolysis, respectively to obtain chitin. Pigments were also decolorized by stirring in ethanol for 5h at 60°C. The extracted chitin was vacuum dried for 24h at 60°C. The extracted chitin was dissolved in 20wt% NaOH solution using freeze-thaw method at -20°C for 4-6 cycles until providing the clear solution. Chitin solution (water phase: W) was then dispersed in hexane/Span 80 (oil phase: 0) at 1500 rpm to perform emulsification. Effects of chitin concentrations, Span 80 concentrations, and 0:W ratios on the size distribution of chitin microgels were studied. Yield of the extracted chitin was 23%, and the degree of acetylation (DA) was 79.8%. The narrow distribution of chitin microgels with the size of 5-6 um was resulted from 3% chitin solution, 5-7% of Span80, and O:W ratios of 7:1-15:1 (Fig. 1). Moreover, chitin microgels showed stimuli-responsive behavior in the different pH environment due to the swelling property possibly (Fig. 2). In conclusion, chitin microgels could be prepared from red snow crab shell waste by emulsification method. The microgels exhibited pH-responsive behavior, which would be applicable in drug delivery system.",,,
3,Enzymatic characterization of S46 peptidase from pathogenic bacteria,"Family S46 peptidase is exo-peptidase that releases the dipeptides from N-terminal of the oligopeptide. In our previous study, we elucidated the SmDPP7 three-dimensional structure of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase BII (DAP BII) from Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana WO24, for the first time in S46 peptidase. In this enzyme, we revealed that the position 675 residue at Si position as the recognition residue at P1 position in oligopeptide is highly conserved in Trouble S46 peptidase and is glycine (G), arginine (R) or serine (S). Therefore, it might cause the different substrate specificity of S46 peptidase. For the DAY conserved amino acid G (G type), DAP Bll shows the activity toward for fatty, aromatic, acidic and basic residues at P1 position. On the other hand, dipeptidyl peptidase 7 (PgDPP7) of G type from periodontal disease bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis shows the proline specificity at P1 position in addition to substrate specificity of DAP Bll. This fact suggests that some novel residue might be present in addition to position 675 in S46 peptidase. The goal of this study is to identify novel recognition residues for elucidation of the determination mechanism of substrate specificity in family S46. Here, we show the analysis of the enzymatic character of SmDPP7 (G type) from Stenotorophomonas maltophilia, multidrug resistance and opportunistic infection bacteria to compare with that of DAP Bll and PgDPP7. In addition, the evaluation of inhibitors against for SmDPP7 designed by three-dimensional structure is presented. From in silico analysis, we estimated the four residues constructing Si subsite that is compared structure of DAP BII and multiple alignment of DAP BII, SmDPP7 and PgDPP7(1). DAP BII, SmDPP7 and PgDPP7 were E. coli expressed and purified to compare the enzymatic analysis (2). In enzymatic analysis, we measured the DPP activity against for five dipeptidyl-pNAs (3). The result showed only PgDPP7 showed acidic amino acid and proline specificity. From the analysis of kinetic parameters, the Michaelis constant against for Met-Leu-MCA of DAPBII, SmDPP7 and PgDPP7 showed the 16.3 uM and 17.2 uM and 128 uM, respectively (4). Therefore, we analyze the substrate specificity and inhibitor effect on DAPBII S1 pocket mutant (S679A, 9682G, N683D, M693T, S679A-S682G-N683D-M693T) to demonstrate that they relate to the substrate recognition. The result showed that acidic amino acid specificity of DAP BI N683D mutant is 25 fold higher than DAP BII WT (5). It suggests position 683 of DAPB Il is residues as P1 Preservation of position 675 in 1355 genes recognition. In structure analysis, we confirmed that superposition of DAP Bll and SmDPP7 are mach. Then 24 inhibitors against for SmDPP7 designed Gly (65.1 %) by three-dimensional structure (6). In inhibitor assay, 24 dipeptide compounds, modification of side chain at Pl and P2 were tested on the DPP activity against for Met-Leu-MCA (7). SmDPP7 and DAPBII has same residues at Si position and showed 80% inhibition by four compounds. In the case of PODPP7 with different four residues at Si position, almost compounds indicated below the 50% inhibition. These results suggest that some inhibitors will help to development of novel drug against pathogenic bacteria and evaluation of residues involved in substrate specificity.","This study, We identified enzymatic character of DAP BII, SmDPP7 and PgDPP7 as G type of $46 peptidase. And estimated four residues from in silico analysis and elucidated position 683 has a potential of P1 recognition. Furthermore, we elucidated structure of VY complex of SmDPP7 by which 24 inhibitors were designed. Some inhibitors will help to development of novel drug against pathogenic bacteria.",,
3,DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TRANSFORMATION METHOD OF EISENIA FETIDA,"Recently, biological medicines which are human therapeutic drugs that made from transformed organisms have attracted a lot of attention. Although heterologous gene expression systems have been developed using various organisms such as microorganisms and higher animals, there are some problems such as high-producing cost and difficulty of producing process. Therefore, we are focusing on the earthworm, Eisenia fetida which can produce post-translational protein modification, as a novel host to solve these problems. Since E. fetida has been approved as the model animal of acute toxicity test by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it has been treated as a widely studied material in the world. Furthermore, it has confirmed that the earthworms can eat safely because we have already developed as a dietary supplement. If we use the earthworm as a recombinant host, we can uptake the earthworms including recombinant proteins because of the reasons as mentioned above. Furthermore, earthworms are known as heavy metal tolerance organisms and its mechanisms are researching widely. Therefore, genetic engineering tools are not only useful for biomedicine production but also elucidation of the mechanism of the gene from the viewpoint of improvement of soil pollution. These tools can contribute to wide range research fields. However, since there were no reports of genetic engineering techniques of the earthworms, we attempted to develop a transformation method of the earthworm firstly. As a result, we succeeded to construct E. fetida transformation method using microinjection and electroporation methods. Furthermore, we could improve the survival rate from 15% to 88%, and also the transformation efficiency from 11% to 16%, using medium modification and so on.

3,"EFFECT OF LOW-PRESSURE TREATMENT AGAINST DIGESTIVE ENZYMES OF EARTHWORM, EISENIA FETIDA","Earthworms are well-known soil decomposers. They have various digestive enzymes because they are polyphagous animals. Earthworms have also been studied for their therapeutic effects against human diseases. Especially, earthworms have potent fibrinolytic enzymes called as Lumbrokinase. The enzyme is very stable even if leave it out at room temperature, and also dried earthworm powder has been found fibrinolytic activity. Therefore, we have developed a novel earthworm dietary supplement having fibrinolytic activities using high-pressure treatment. However, some digestive enzyme activities were lost by high-pressure treatment. Since digestive enzymes such as amylase are also useful for our health, we investigate these enzymes activities under the lowpressure treatment. The earthworms, Eisenia fetida Waki, were starved for 24 h. The starved earthworms were washed and disrupted by a mixer. The mixture was centrifuged. After that, pressure and heat treatments against the supernatant were performed at various hours. The treated sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for various enzyme assay.","As a result, low-pressure treatment did not have an enhancing effect of earthworm endoglucanase, which is one of the cellulases, activity. On the other hand, amylase and lumbrokinase activities were enhanced by low-pressure treatment. These results show that the low-pressure treatment may be useful as a development of earthworm dietary supplement.",,

4,Self-management and reflection sheets for student skills development," Despite quality education has been improved by several efforts, 103 million youth in the world still lacks basic literacy skills [1]. In addition to the fact, teachers' education quality level is not sufficient in several developing countries [2]. From the perspective of Goal 4 targets in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), educational supports from advanced countries are required (e.g. detachment of teacher and acceptance of international students). Before doing so, educational quality in advanced countries must consider to improve teaching ways for development of lifelong learners because especially teachers in higher education perform lectures based on their technical knowledge and experiences, which sometimes are not considered about lifelong learning. Therefore, to achieve the high-level of quality education for development of lifelong learners, systematic and standardized methods for improvement of students and teachers levels are necessary. In this study, to provide better learning environments for both, we attempt to develop self-management and reflection sheets, which can keep students learning activity, evaluate teachers' lecture and student education level constantly, and provide any learning environments owing to simpler/cheaper ways.

6,DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FLOOD FORECASTING FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATION OF FLOOD FIGHTING ACTIVITIES AND ITS PRACTICAL VERIFICATION,"In July 2011, Niigata and Fukushima heavy rainfall occurred. Niigata and Fukushima heavy rainfall has caused damages of simultaneous multiple flood disasters in some municipal units within Niigata Prefecture. We are developing a new flood forecasting framework for simultaneous multiple flood disasters. Our new flood forecasting framework focuses on river discharge. We simulate all river discharges by the fridbased distributed hydrological model. The new flood forecasting framework based on statistical relationship between simulated long-term past river discharge and current river discharge. This statistical relationship can predict when and where whether increase flood hazard in all rivers. Recently, we are verifying accuracy of simulation in medium and small size rivers on the grid based distributed hydrological model. We need to use observation river discharge for verifying simulation river discharge. However, medium and small size rivers observation river discharge data is scarce. Therefore, river discharge is represented form observed rain fall and water level in this study. We carried out streamflow observation by the radio wave current  meter and the vide analysis soft (KU-STIV) to verify river discharge.",,,

6,Cultivation of ureolytic microorganisms using a down-flow hanging sponge bioreactor system," Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. Urease activity is widely observed in the environment, and so, ureolytic microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, fungi, and algae) may play important roles in the nitrogen cycle. Several studies have reported that urease-mediated carbonate precipitation has the potential to strengthen the soil foundation and to remediate heavy metals from aquatic environments. However, for industrial application of this technique, coninuous production of ureolytic microorganisms poses a significant challenge.
 In the present study, we examined the applicability of a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) bioreactor system (Fig.1) for cultivating ureolytic microorganisms. A soil sample collected from the schoolyard of the National Institute of Technology, Wakayama College, was was used as the inoculum for the bioreactor. A yeast extract-based medium with 167 mM urea was continuously supplied at 35 mL/h, corresponding to a theoretical hydraulic retention time of 5.5 h. The bioreactor was maintained in a dark, temperature-controlled room (25 ± 2 °C). A total operation period of 72 days was divided into three phases based on the yeast extract concentration in the supplied medium and the presence/absence of air supplied with an air pump. The growth of ureolytic microorganisms in the DHS bioreactor was monitored based on potential urease activity,which was determined using a conductivity method.
 Following the operation of the bioreactor system, the urease activity were detected from the polyurethane sponge-attached biofilms. A maximum urease activity of 26.4 ± 0.5 μmol/mL/min (mean ± standard error) was obtained during phase Ⅲ (in the presence of air supply and 5 g/L yeast extract in the supplied medium); the obtained activity would be sufficient for direct application in bioremediation. Our data demonstrated that the DHS bioreactor system is a useful system for the cultivation of ureolytic microorganisms.",,,
6,Development of energy efficient wastewater treatment system for high-organic loading acid-based wastewater," The advantage of anaerobic wastewater treatment including upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor can recover methane from organic matter as energy. The economic growth of developing countries is remarkable, and a large amount of organic wastewater such as palm oil manufacturing wastewater is discharged from various industries. The wastewater is often treated with anaerobic ponds, but it requires a long retention time, and greenhouse gases (methane and carbon dioxide) was produced and discharged to atmosphere. In addition to the problems, simple management and cheaper wastewater treatment systems are required for the developing countries because of insufficient numbers of expert engineers. Therefore, this study attempt to develop a low running cost and energy saving wastewater treatment system combining an UASB reactor and a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor to treat Shochu distillery wastewater (industrial alcohol-producing wastewater) containing high concentrations of organic and nitrogen compounds with insufficient alkalinity. Especially, in this study, to reduce running cost and saving energy for efficient wastewater treatment, two attempts were conducted. 1) For further reduction of the alkali supplement, we introduced multi-feeding system into the UASB reactor. 2) By installing the DHS reactor as post-treatment of UASB effluent, remaining organic and nitrogen compounds are treated under no temperature control and no aeration conditions. Our proposed system can be solved the Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals because of the potentials of global warming prevention, energy conservation, and effective treatment for high-organic containing wastewater.",,,
6,Evaluation of performance of novel Rotational sponge (RS) reactor for nitrification process," Nitrogen is removed through oxidation of ammonia to nitrate through nitrification process and reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas through denitrification process (Kim et al. 2013). Because of the low growth rate and higher oxygen demand, nitrification is generally a rate limiting and economically expensive step in conventional wastewater treatment systems. Therefore developing new wastewater treatment systems beyond conventional systems have become recent trend. On this verge novel Rotational sponge (RS) reactor was developed and its application for the nitrification process was studied.Concept of RS reactor is similar to the water wheel that is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle. Method uses an attached growth type treatment processes employing polyethylene sponges as support media for the growth of bacteria. Buckets arranged on the outside rim lift the influent with the rotation and allow wastewater to flow through packed sponges in the middle (Fig. 1). Objective this study to determine physical oxygen transfer rate (P-OTR) from atmosphere as O2 is a critical factor for nitrification and to analyze the performance of nitrification of the RS reactor.

6,IMMOBILIZATION OF RADIOACTIVE CESIUM IN ZEOLITE COMPOSIT FIBERS COMPRESSED TO REDUCTIVE AND SAFETY PRESERVING FORMS,"The Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan on March 11 2011 has produced huge amounts of radioactive cesium and still people survive in Fukushima area after five years was passed. In their radioactive chemicals, especially, Cesium(Cs) has long half-life about 30.5 years. For purpose of the safety from of the Cs, the present paper reported zeolite polymer composite fiber (ZCF) fabricated to compact storage form in the immobilization of the Cs. The ZCF was changed from fiber from into a pellet form and decreased the volume, showing about 1/6 reduction (Fig.1) by heat treatment in the range of 100-800°C. The behavior of the immobilized ZCF matrix to Cs leakage was examined in non-radiocative Cs and radiocative Cs for different fabricatino condition. (Fig. 2)",,,
6,PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF CHITIN-HALLOYSITE NANOCLAY HYDROGEL COMPOSITE FOR ADSORPTION OF Cu (Ⅱ) ION," In the present study, Chitin-Halloysite nanoclay (CT-HNC) hydrogels were prepared by wer phase inversion process in water at room temperature. The hydrpogels were used to be on chemically cross-linking agent and to absorb Cu(Ⅱ) ion. In the present work chitin (CT) was extracted from crab shells and then, dissolved in N, N-dimethyl aceramine/Lithium chloride (DMAc/ LiCl) as a solvent. The resultant hydrogel composites were obtained at different halloysite nanoclay (HNC) contents in variations from 0.1 to 4wt%. The composite hydrogels were evaluated in different loading amounts of HNC by tensile strength and viscoelasity. The hydrogel composites were enhanced in the tensile strength, while the elongation was decreased when the loading was increased. For heavy metal ion removal, adsorption experiments were carried out as shown in Fig. 1 for equilibrium isotherm of CU (Ⅱ) in different loading hydrogels. These showed that the hydrogels removed Cu (Ⅱ) ion at pH 6 by adsorption. IT was observed that the increase of HNC amount in hydrogel composite caused higher adsorption of Cu (Ⅱ) ion, as fitted to Langmuir model.",,,

6,Development of UASB-DHS-A2SBR system for sewage treatment,"The emerging technology consisting of Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB), Down-flow Hanging Sponge (DHS) and Anaerobic/anoxic Sequencing Batch Reactor (A2SBR) could be a competitive solution. UASB-DHS has been regarded as economically advantageous system over conventional activated sludge system and even well known for good organic removal rate meeting the discharge standards of developing countries [1]. However, this system could not treat nutrients well. For effective nutrient removal in the system, A SBR was employed. In ASBR, Denitrifying Phosphate Accumulating Organisms (DNPAOs) under anaerobic condition uptake volatile fatty acids and store them as polyhyroxyalkanoates (PHAs) through hydrolysis of intracellular polyphosphate and glycolysis of glycogen and under anoxic condition, utilize nitrate as electron acceptor and PHAs to generate energy for growth, glycogen synthesis and phosphate uptake [2].",,,
6,"PROCESS PERFORMANCE OF A DOWNFLOW HANGING SPONGE REACTOR FOR DIRECT TREATMENT OF DOMESTIC WASTEWATER IN BANGKOK, THAILAND","The main objective in this study to evaluate process performances of a pilot-scale down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor for direct treatment of domestic wastewater (influent COD = 150–170 mg/L and BOD = 60–90 mg/L) in Bangkok, Thailand. The process performance was evaluated under both continuous flow experiment and flow rate fluctuation experiment. The schematic diagram of the DHS reactor used in this study was shown in Fig.1. As a results, throughout the evaluation period of 550 days, the DHS reactor performed for the removal of organic carbon (COD removal rate = 80–83% and BOD removal rate = 91%), nitrogen compounds (total nitrogen removal rate = 45–51% and NH4+-N removal rate = 95– 98%), and production of excess sludge (0.04 gTS/gCOD removed) at a hydraulic retention time of 3 hours. In addition, the DHS reactor also demonstrated sufficient COD and NH4-N removal rates in flow rate fluctuation experiment that simulates a small-scale treatment facility. These results show that the DHS reactor could be applied as a small-scale plant for domestic wastewater treatment in tropical regions such as Bangkok, Thailand.",,,

6,Development of an Anaerobic Baffled Reactor for Treating Natural Rubber Processing Wastewater,"Natural rubber processing wastewater contains high concentration of organic compounds and ammonia. An anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) is a single reactor configuration with compartmentalization within could employ the benefits of a stage separation scheme. In this study, a laboratory-scale experiment was conducted to evaluate process performance of ABR consisted by 10 compartments for treating this wastewater. The ABR was started up with an influent total COD of 3,000 mg/L. The organic loading rate (OLR) of ABR was increased stepwise by increasing influent COD concentration. The COD removal reached 88 + 14% with OLR of 0.74 +0.18 kg-COD/m day. The effluent was 139 + 22 mg/L of total COD, 460 44 mg-N/L of TN and 25 + 9 mg/L of TSS. After increased OLR to 1.15 + 0.07 kg-COD/m.day, the process performance of ABR was deteriorated and foam was observed in the surface of reactor. The microbial community structure of ABR was analyzed by using next generation sequencer Miseq (Ilumina). Phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicultes, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi were dominated in the all compartments. Megasphera and unclassified bacteria belonging to phylum Bacteroidetes that reported as acetogen were dominated in the 1st and 2nd compartment of the reactor. Volatile fatty acid oxidizing bacteria, Syntrophomonas and Syntrophus were highly detected in the 3rd to 6th compartments. In archaea, acetate utilizing methanogen Methanosaeta was predominantly detected in the 3rd and 4th compartments with abundance of 9.8% to 16.4%. This result indicated that acidification was occurred in the upstream of ABR. In addition, methane fermentation was occurred in the middle part of ABR. These results indicated that ABR could be an appropriate treatment system for this wastewater.",,,
6,APPLICATION OF STEP FEEDING DOWNFLOW HANGING SPONGE REACTOR FOR PARTIAL NITRIFICATION,"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process is a novel nitrogen removal technology for ammonium rich wastewater. To apply anammox to wastewater treatment, partial nitrification of ammonium to nitrite is one of the most important reactions. This study, a Down-flow Hanging Sponge (DHS) reactor was applied for development of cost effective, no aeration energy needed, partial nitrification process. The specification of DHS reactor is as follows. Right triangular prism sponges (30mm x 25 mm X 40 mm) were used as filter media. 104 sponges were tiled in PVC sheet and divided it into 4 units (26 sponges/unit). The reactor height and sponge volume were 4.4 m and 1.6 L respectively. Methane fermentation digestion liquid containing ammonium of 400 mgN/L was fed to the DHS reactor. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The DHS reactor was operated more than 500 days under three conditions, conventional 1-spot feeding (day 0-133), 2-step feeding (day 134-325; fed wastewater at heights of 0 and 2.2 m) and 4-step feeding (day 326-516; fed wastewater at heights of 0, 1.1, 2.2 and 3.3 m). Nitrogen volumetric loading late was 1.6 kgN/mreactor/day in all conditions. Under 1-spot and 2-step feeding condition, effluent pH was decreased around 6.0 despite wastewater pH was 8.5. The pH decrease due to nitrification caused no nitrite accumulation. On the other hand, about 90% of oxidized ammonium was accumulated as nitrite under 4-step feeding condition. From the results of waster quality profile along reactor height under 4-step feeding condition, the pH was maintained around 8.0 even nitrification occurred. In addition, the dissolved oxygen at the depth of 1 mm from sponge surface was below 1 mg/L. They were suitable conditions for partial nitrification). Therefore, the DHS reactor achieved it without aeration energy. Retained sludge of the DHS reactor on day 516 had 26-49 mg-N/g-VSS/day of denitrification activity. From the activity profile along reactor height, applying step feeding to DHS reactor promoted not only partial nitrification but also denitirification.",,,
6,Cultivation of organohalide respiring bacteria and genetic identification of reductive dehalogenase gene in a nobel Chloroflexi bacterium,"Anaerobic microorganisms capable of organohalide respiration have been used for bioremediation to degrade chlorinated solvent contamination. The organohalide respiration is catalyzed by reductive dehalogenase (RDH). Recently, it has been reported that the presence of phylogenetically diverse RDH homologous genes in marine subsurface sediments [1,2], and the RDH homologous genes are distinct from previously known RDH genes. Some researchers also reported that marine organisms produce the organohalide compounds [3]. However, there is no report on cultivation of organohalide microorganisms from marine subsurface sediments. We have challenged to cultivate anaerobic organohalide respiring bacteria from subseafloor sediments, and they will be useful to understand detail mechanism of organohalide metabolism and evolution. In this study, we report successful isolation of a potentially organohalide respiring bacterium, designated strain MO-CFX2, form marine subsurface sediment. Isolation of the bacterium was archived using a combination of long-term continuous-flow bioreactor cultivation and elaborated batch-type cultivation techniques 14). The bacterium was affiliated with an uncultured group in the class Anaerolineae with in phylum Chloroflexi and was originally enriched and isolated under anaerobic fermentative condition, i.e., anaerobic medium supplemented with glucose and yeast extract. Interestingly, we found a unique RDH gene cluster in its draft genome sequences. This finding strongly suggests that strain MO-CFX2 get energy via not only fermentation but also anaerobic respiration of organohalide. We tested many organohalide compounds to know the ability organohalide respiration of strain MO-CFX2. As a result, strain MO-CFX2 probably used brominated compounds as electron acceptors for anaerobic organoghalide respiration. So far, in the phylum Chloroflexi, the presence of organohalide respiration bacteria is limited to the class Dehalococcoidia. Our finding expands the knowledge about diversity of organohalide respiring microorganisms and provides physiological and genetic characteristics of Anaerolineae bacterium, which belongs to one of the ecologically import but previously uncultured bacterial groups in marine subsurface environments.",,,
6,Identification and Detection of Prokaryotic Symbionts in Metopus living in Up-flow Anarobic Sludge Blanket Reactor,"In the up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor fed with domestic sewage, anaerobic bacteria, archaea and also protozoa are coexisting, while physiological role of the anaerobic protozoa is largely unknown. Some of anaerobic protozoa harbor methanogen as endosymbionts. We focused on possibility of contribution of methane production from this endosymbionts. To clarify endosymbionts of anaerobic protozoa, we investigated the endosymbiotic prokaryotic community structure of the anaerobic ciliate, Metopus sp. living in UASB reactor using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Metopus sp. was physically separated by using micromanipulator from anaerobic granular sludge in a domestic wastewater treatment plant and anoxically cultivated for 7 days. After 3, 5 and 7 day of cultivation, endosymbiotic prokaryotic community structures of Metopus sp. were examined by determining the amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences using next generation sequencer. The most common prokaryotes identified were related to the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoregula boonei or to the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium aminobutyricum. The FISH analysis using the oligonucleotide probes Mg1200b and Cla568 and TEM analysis demonstrated that these prokaryotes were localized inside of Metopus cells. In Metopus cells, M. boonei-like prokaryotes were located near hydrogen-forming organelle, hydrogenosome. In contrast, C. aminobutyricum-like prokaryotes formed cell cluster in the cytoplasm. These results suggest M. boonei- and C. aminobutyricum-like prokaryotes as novel endosymbionts of Metopus ciliates.",,,
6,Influence of Recirculation for System Performance and Microbial Community Structure of UASB-DHS System,"Methane fermentation process has been paid attention as energy that able to replaced fossil fuel consumption. This process can apply to treat excess sludge, food waste and livestock waste. Recently, the number of methane formation plant has been increased by new Feed-In Tariff (FIT) in Japan. Methane formation process produce methane and anaerobic digestion effluent as final product. The anaerobic digestion effluent contains high concentration of organic and nitrogen component. Anaerobic digestion effluent is used as liquid manure because it contains nutrients. However, the excessive application of anaerobic digestion effluent is the probable cause of nitrogen pollution in farming areas. In addition, this application is unsuitable for urban areas because of odor of wastewater, limited agricultural area and seasons. In other way, anaerobic digestion effluent is treated by conventional activate sludge process. However, this process required high energy costs for aeration and treatment area. Therefore, development of low cost treatment system for anaerobic digestion effluent is required.","UASB-DHS process performance and microbial community for treating anaerobic digestion effluent was evaluated. Total COD removal rates and total nitrogen removal rates were achieved in 80% and 76%, respectively. The performance were increased by using recirculation between UASB and DHS. 71 Microbial community composition of UASB retained sludge was changed in recirculation and OLR.",,

6,Development of DHS Reactor for Dyes Wastewater Treatment,"Conventional activated sludge process, precipitation by the addition of chemicals, ozone oxidation, etc. are widely used for wastewater treatment discharged from a dyeing factory. These methods are often costly energy requirements and frequent use chemicals. It is estimated that the amount of dyes wastewater discharged in Japan is 1,000,000 m3/day. Therefore, development of an appropriate treatment system for this wastewater is required. A down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor is a trickling filter using sponges as a medium. The DHS reactor has the advantages of energy saving and low operational cost because of no external aeration. In this study, the application of dyes wastewater treatment was examined using a DHS reactor. In addition, the DO distribution in the sponge medium was investigated by using an oxygen needle sensor. In this study, laboratory-scale DHS reactor had a length of 1.2 m was used. The effective volume (sponge volume) of DHS reactor was 2.0 L. Influent for DHS reactor was collected from actual dying factory in Nagaoka, Japan. The DHS reactor was operated at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 hours. During run 2, the effluent was recirculated in order to improved process performance (recirculation ratio 1). The DHS reactor performed 766%, 934%, 37+15% and 53–15% of total-COD, total-BOD, TN and Color removal, respectively. In addition, the effluent of DHS reactor achieved the Japanese discharge standards (pH:5.8-8.6, BOD:120 mg/L, TN:60 mg/L). After effluent recirculation, the removal efficiencies of total-COD, total-BOD and TN was increased to 816%, 9612% and 49:11%. However, color removal was decrease to 46–18%. This reduction of color removal was considered that nitrate was returned to the DHS influent and denitrifying bacteria could dominate in the sponge medium According to DO profile in the sponge medium, DO almost became 0 mg/L at 2 mm from surface of sponge medium. On the other hand, but DO almost became 0 mg/L at 4 mm from surface of sponge medium when operated with recirculation ratio 1 was set. Therefore, the effluent recirculation contributed to the higher DO diffusion inside the sponge medium. These result shows that the DHS reactor is applicable in dyes wastewater treatment. However, it is required further study for improve color removal.",,,

7,Investigations into Properties of New Functional Carbon Particles for Applicatin in Electrochemical Energy Conversion,"Recently, functional carbon materials are garnering attention because they have many interesting properties and are cheaper than noble metals (Pt, Au, etc). In particular, new electrodes utilizing functional carbon materials are expected to substitute the Pt electrode. In recent years, new carbon particles (CPs) from methane have been developed by microwave-assisted catalytic decomposition. CPs mainly constitutes nickel-covered nanographene (Fig. 1). In this study, we measured and assessed the electrochemical properties of CPs. The CPs were pretreated with 0.1M sulfuric acid. After the pretreatment, CPs or platinum on nanocarbon (Pt/C) were packed into a porous microelectrode (PME, 0 =50 u m). We performed electrochemical measurements in the electrolytic solutions using a potentiostat/galvanostat and a function generator. We used Pt, Au, and carbon-fiber microelectrodes as well as PME as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt coil as the auxiliary electrode. The electrolytic solutions were 0.1M Na2SO4(aq) and 0.1M H2SO4(aq) saturated with O2, 0.1M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF) in acetonitrile saturated with 02, and 10 mM NaClO in 1M Na S04. Figure 2 shows the typical current-potential curves in 0.1 M H2SO4 saturated with O2 (scan rate = 10 mV/s). At PME packed CPs, the onset potential for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is observed at around +0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Similarly, at PME packed Pt/C, the onset potential for ORR is observed at +0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This result suggests that, 1) the onset potential in acidic medium for ORR at CPs is as good as that for a Pt/C, 2) the electron transfer at CPs is slower than Pt/C from the potential to steady state.",,,

7,Experimental study on Reducing Technique of Voltage and Current Distortion by 3-level Inventer with Asymmetrical DC Voltage Sources,"Inverters can convert DC power to AC power with an arbitrary amplitude and frequency. Recently, they are required low power loss and low distortion of the output voltage and current. Multilevel inverters can reduce the switching loss and the voltage and current distortion though the configurations of the main circuit and the control circuit are complicated. This paper proposes a new multilevel inverter whose circuit is the same as a conventional 3-level inverter but the DC-link voltages are asymmetry. (Fig. 1) The voltage and current THDs are evaluated when the two-phase modulation techniques which are the negative voltage based method(NVBM) and the positive voltage based method(PVBM) are used. The simulation and experimental results with the system which has two DC-link voltages (total voltage is 120 V) show the effects of the proposed technique. The following results have been obtained. (1) In NVBM, the proposed technique can reduce the voltage and current THDs in the low modulation ratio more than the conventional method. The larger the ratio of the DC-link voltages are, the lower the THDs becomes. (2) In PVBM, the proposed technique can reduce THDs more than the conventional method when the one DClink voltage is 65 V or 70 V. (3) The proposed technique, which switches NVBM and PVBM, can reduce the THDs except around the modulation ratio of 0.6 when the one DC-link voltage is 65 V. (Fig. 2)",,,

7,"Development of Electron utilizing bacteria specific ""directly"" isolation device","Development of energy recovery technology is an important issue for achieving sustainable development. We have studied energy recovery technology from waste biomass. This technique is characterized by using as a catalyst a bacteria that uses an electron as an energy source (Electron utilizing bacteria; EUB). By constructing a reactor with EUB, it is possible to convert ""waste"" to ""valuable"" with one reactor. Up to now, we succeeded in producing a trace amount of acetate using EUB. However, it is essential to add high value to the product for industrialization of this technique. For that purpose, it is necessary to isolate EUB that can produce various valuable commodity chemicals from the environment. Therefore, we developed a device called Solid-Phase Electrochemical Colonization and Isolation Equipment System (SPECIES) that can isolate EUB directly from the environment. This apparatus is characterized by using a carbon nano-tube (CNT) coated petri dish as an electron donor of EUB. Specific separation of EUB was attempted by spotting gellan gum on a CNT petri dish, dropping anaerobic digested sludge, and culturing in anaerobic state at -600 mV for 3 weeks. After operation, microbial community were analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. As a result, it became clear that the community structure was different on the presence or absence of voltage application. Currently, we are proceeding with the identification of DGGE bands specific to the voltage applied culture.",,,
7,PRE-RESEARCH FOR ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE OF WATER MOLECULE ADOSORVED GRAPHITE SURFACE,"The nano carbon materials have attracted much attention because of their applications to various devices such as energy storage and metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. Graphite is formed by multi layers of two-dimensional crystal of sp2-bonded carbons, which has excellent properties with high electron mobility and thermal conductivity. When these properties were applied to electronic devices, the knowledge concerning with surface and interface condition of formed insulating film on semiconductor is very important. In this work, as the foundation of a device process, we have studied about oxidation and hydrogenation processes on HOPG surface at room temperature by metastable atom induced electron spectroscopy (MIES) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). MIES and LEED observations were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. The experimental setup was equipped with helium metastable atom (He source, LEED optics, and hemispherical energy analyzer (CLAM2, VG). The sample is highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate, cleaned by scotch tape method in the air and annealed by direct current Joule heating around 600 °C in the UHV chamber. The HOPG clean surface was observed the ring pattern by LEED. Oxygen and hydrogen gasses were exposed to HOPG surface at room temperature separately. We measured HOPG surface with oxygen exposures up to 20 L using MIES. The MIES spectrum at clean surface showed a peak around 15 eV, labeled Pa, originated in the electron emission from C(π). With increasing oxygen exposures, the intensity of Px slightly decreased and two electronic structures induced by oxygen (Poi and Po2) appeared in middle energy region. Next, hydrogen gas was exposed to oxygen adsorbed HOPG surface. At hydrogen exposures less than 300 L, the intensity of peaks (Poi and Po2) decreased. It indicates that the adsorbed oxygen atoms were reduced by hydrogen reduction reaction. By the additional hydrogen exposures up to 1500 L, a new peak (PC-H) due to induced C-H bond appeared around 8 eV in MIES spectra [1]. The intensity of this peak increased with increasing hydrogen exposures. This result implies that the HOPG surface was hydrogenated. We will discuss about the electronic structures of oxygen and hydrogen adsorbed HOPG surface.",,,

However, the non-thermal microplasmas are unstable state and transform immediately to thermal plasma. On the other hand, nanosecond pulsed plasmas are known well that one of the means for creating non-thermal reaction field. Here, we have studied on hydrogen production from water by using the nanosecond pulsed discharge plasma and generation of non-thermal nanosecond pulsed microplasma assisted by field emission electron from a vertically-arranged carbon nanotube cathode. In this presentation, we discuss results about measurement of variation of a particle density in nanosecond pulsed discharge plasma by laser Michelson interferometry. The Michelson interferometry is constituted of a continues laser, optical fibers arranged one-dimensionally and high-speed response photodiode detector. Positive pulsed voltages with maximum output 25 kV and pulse width 200 ns were applied to anode electrode. The vertically-arranged carbon nanotubes are fixed on cathode plane electrode by an electrical conductive tape. The laser and detectors in the interferometry were used a continuous He-Ne laser (632 nm) and a Si photodiode with rise time 1 ns, respectively. The observed fringe in the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. The variation of particle density in the discharge is measured quantitatively by using the fringe shift amount.",,,
7,ALGAL GROWTH EFFECTS OF ELUATE FROM A CHELATING AGENT,"Microalgae have attracted attention for use as biofuels because they do not compete for food resources as corn and sugar corn production might. Nevertheless, the growth rate of microalgae is lower than that of bacteria. It remains a challenge to use microalgae as a stable fuel source. This study investigated a method to grow microalgae effectively, particularly examining effects on Parachlorella kessleri (Chlorella kessleri) by eluate from a commercial resin for immobilized metal ion adsorption chromatography. First, the chelating resin was mixed with ultrapure water. Then the supernatant was filtrated using a 0.45 um pore filter. Each eluate concentration was expressed as the total organic carbon (TOC). Secondly, algae were cultured in CA medium containing eluate of various concentrations. After incubation of algae with eluate, the algal number was estimated using hemocytometry. The effects of the eluate on algal growth were compared with those of algal growth factor sesamol. Moreover, the thermal tolerance of the eluate was assessed by bioassay using algae and UV/IR spectrophotometries. Finally, the eluate was subjected to freeze-drying for purification of materials from the eluate. After treatment of algae with the eluate, the algal growth increased concentration-dependently (Fig. 1). Moreover, the proliferative effect of the eluate on algae was greater than that of sesamol. It is particularly interesting that the heated eluate decreased the proliferative effect on algae. Analyses using UV/IR spectroscopies revealed that the decreased proliferative effect might result from the conformational change of the biologically active substances in the eluate. Taking thought thermosensitivity of the eluate, the entity in the eluate was refined by freeze-drying, which produced fine-grained crystals. Structural analyses using LC-MS and NMR might elucidate the molecular structure of the substance from the eluate.",,,
7,Genome Research for New Clean Energy using Next Generation Sequencer Miseq,"Recently, we have various problems, for example, depletion of fossil fuel, global warming by CO2 and environmental destruction. Therefore, biomass has been attracted attention. The biomass is renewable and alternative energy other than fossil fuel. Typical biomass are Cellulose, Chitin and Chitosan. But, these are not almost utilized yet. To promote utilizing biomass, it is needed searching novel enzymes degrading biomass and developing new methods of efficient bio-conversion. We aimed to solve those problems from information of genome obtained by researching with Miseq (NGS: Next Generation Sequencer), thanks to collaborate with TriInstitutional Collaborative/ Cooperative Educational Reform Project. First, some bacteria degrading chitin and chitosan were screened and isolated for searching novel enzymes. And we found chitinase genes and chitosanase genes from these bacteria by complete genome analysis using Miseq. Next, a bacterial flora of soil around root of oleander Japanese: KYOTIKUTO) was investigated to discover novel bacteria degrading oleandrin, the poison of oleander. If we can degrade oleandrin by workings of bacteria, oleander is able to use as biomass. Result, we identified chitinase gene and chitosanase gene from genome of bacteria from Okinawan soil. And, we revealed bacterial flora of soil around root of oleander. Thus, we made it possible to research for using Miseq in National Institute of Tecnology Okinawa College by Tri-Institutional Collaborative/ Cooperative Educational Reform Project.",,,
7,"""Expansion of FRT Operation Range for Grid-Tied Matrix Converter System""","Nowadays, wind turbine systems have attracted attentions as a sustainable energy system. In the wind turbine systems, the fault-ride-through (FRT) regulations for the grid-tied converter are applied in many countries in order to avoid a power interruption in a large scale when only a local grid fault occurs. A power converter employed in the wind turbine must satisfy the FRT regulation as following: 1) the wind turbine system needs to continue to operate during the grid voltage sag when the remaining voltage and its duration are within a limitation defined by the grid regulation; 2) a reactive current is delivered to the grid dependently on the remaining voltage. Moreover, in the wind turbine system, the generator torque needs to be maintained regardless of the grid state in order to avoid unexpected acceleration and vibration of the wind turbine. Thus, a grid-tied converter is also required the following capability aside from the FRT regulation: 3) the grid-tied converter has to maintain the generator torque during the grid voltage sag as same as that in the normal operation. On the other hand, a matrix converter has attracted many attentions as a high-performance AC-AC converter. The matrix converter is expected to achieve higher efficiency, smaller size and longer lifetime compared to a conventional back-to-back (BTB) system. In previous works, grid-tied systems using the matrix converter for the wind turbine or a micro turbine systems have been reported. A conventional FRT control method for the matrix converter has been proposed to achieve 1) the stable FRT operation, 2) the grid reactive current control and 3) the generator torque control in the same time during the voltage sag. However, in this control method, the generator current amplitude is limited because only the q-axis current is controlled whereas the d-axis current is kept to zero. Consequently, the matrix converter cannot satisfy the FRT conditions of more than the voltage sag of 43% for the grid current due to the limitation of the generator current. This paper proposes the FRT method for the grid-tied matrix converter in order to expand the FRT range. The proposed method maintained the 4-axis current to keep the generator torque constant and injected the d-axis current in order to adjust the generator power factor. This increased the maximum grid reactive current, which expanded the FRT range. From the simulation results, the proposed method realized the stable FRT operation during the voltage sag of 70%. Furthermore, the maximum value of the grid reactive current was increased by 15% as compared to that of the conventional method. Consequently, the range of the FRT operation was expanded by 57pt from 43% or less to 100%.",,,
7,"Design of Flyer Velocity Measurement System for Flyer Acceleration by Intense Pulsed Power Supply ""ETIGO-Ⅱ""","Physical properties of insulator materials in extreme high energy density state are needed for various fields, such as a silicate for the planetary science [1], a diamond-like carbon for optimization of ignition process in the fast-ignition inertial confinement fusion [2], and so on. Warm Dense Matter (WDM) is a region of high-energy-density state, which relies on dense (1021-1024cm) and moderate temperature (10-10-K). The Joule-heating by using pulsed power discharge is not suitable to generate the WDM from these insulator materials. ""ETIGO-II"" is one of the intense pulsed power generator [3] and proposed to use the generating system of WDM of insulator by flyer impact used the intense electron beams. [4] However the flyer velocity was not measured in this system and need to develop the measurement system. In this study, we designed to measure the flyer velocity by TOF from shadow graphs using backlight spulsed laser. The test results of moving a thin wire is shown clearly shadows on photograph that means the shadows of flyer is same thickness will be taken on photograph.",,,
7,EFFECT OF HIGH-ENERGY HELIUM BEAM IRRADIATION IN TUNGSTEN TO MEASURE EROSION FOR PLASMA FACING MATERIAL IN MAGNETIC CONFINEMENT FUSION SYSTEM,"In magnetic confinement fusion devices, helium ions were generated by nuclear fusion reaction. The first wall of a vacuum vessel and divertor were damaged due to escaped helium ions from magnetic lines. Thus the tungsten material was expected as the candidate of plasma facing materials because it has high melting point, high spattering resistance, etc. However, by irradiation of low energy helium ions (< keV), erosions have been observed such as bubble structures called helium bubble, filament structures called W-fuzz, and so on. In addition, high-energy helium ions (-MeV) are irradiated to the first wall by ripple losses. It is important to estimate irradiation damages in the tungsten material due to high-energy helium because this effect can degrade the performance of the first wall. In this study, we investigate the irradiation effect for tungsten in depth direction by helium ions at energy of 4 MeV. Using a tandem accelerator, Heion beam at energy of 4MeV was irradiated to a tungsten plate to generate the damages in depth direction. Where, the particle fluence was achieved approximately 1022 ions/m. Using a focused ion beam (FIB) system, the tungsten sample was processed to thin thickness (-100nm) that can be observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using the TEM system, diffraction images were acquired at helium irradiated area and non-irradiated area. As a result, Debye-Scherrer rings were observed for the diffraction patterns in the helium non-irradiated area. In contrast, at the helium irradiated area, diffraction patterns were changed in comparison with non-irradiated area. This result suggests that grain size was increased due to the high-energy helium irradiation.",,,

7,Cell Performance and Stability of Ni1-xCox-YSZ Cermet Anode for the Electrochemical Oxidation of Methane,"Development of proper metal or alloy catalysts combined with an oxide-ion conductor is required for the electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). We have investigated the cell performance of an anode consisting of Ni-Co solid-solution alloy (Nij-xCox) particles combined with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte particles. The Nio.75C00.25-YSZ|YSZ|Lao.:Sro.2 MnO; cell showed the highest performance both for hydrogen and methane at 650-800°C among the composition X = 0 to 0.75. The maximum power density of the Nio.75CO0.25-YSZ cell was 1.4 times as large as that of the Ni-YSZ cell for hydrogen at 750°C. By comparison, the maximum power density of the Nio.75CO0.25-YSZ cell was 2.1 times for methane under the same experimental condition. The prominent increase in the performance of the Nio.75C00.25-YSZ cell was observed for methane more than that for hydrogen. This effect was confirmed by the AC impedance analysis and the DC polarization measurement. The relation between the cell performance and the anode microstructure showed that a moderate amount of Co addition to Ni can impede the grain growth of the Ni metal matrix particles and increase the triple phase boundary area, which is favourable for keeping the cell stability for prolonged operation of an SOFC fuelled with methane.",,,
7,Visualization of nuclei in Trichoderma reesei,"Filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei has been reported to produce a large amount of cellulolytic enzymes. Therefore, many researches have focused on gene expression and genome analysis in T. reesei for the industrial usefulness of cellulase. In addition, recent researches have shown the relationship between morphology of T. reesei and its cellulase producing mechanism. The difference of hyphae morphology between the standard strain QM9414 and the cellulase high-producing mutant PC-3-7 when they grew on cellulose culture (cellulase producing condition) and glucose culture (cellulase non-producing condition) has been reported. Furthermore, the intracellular morphology of T. reesei hyphae was analyzed in details by reconstructing 3D images of QM9414 and PC-3-7 from 500 serial sections captured by focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIBSEM). These 3D images showed that the number of nuclei per cell of cellulose culture was less than that of glucose culture. The result suggests that the change in number of nuclei maybe related to cellulase productivity. In this study, to elucidate the relationship between the number of nuclei and cellulase productivity, in vivo visualization of nuclear was performed. The number of nuclei was investigated in each cell compartment, by staining nuclei with SYTO 9, that is green fluorescent reagent for staining nucleic acid. Consequently, the number of nuclei per cell in cellulose culture was less than that in glucose culture. However, all of nuclei were unlikely to be stained by SYTO 9. To solve this problem, a histone protein H2B that constructs nucleosome in nuclei was fused to green fluoresce protein (GEP) and expressed in QM9414 strain. Currently, expression of GFP in QM9414 strain is being analyzed by confocal laser microscope.",GFP-H2B was successfully expressed in QM9414. Visualization of nuclei in live cell of T. reesei is the important step to analysis the relationship between the chance of nuclei and cellulase productivity.,,
7,Transcriptional regulation mechanism of proteases in Trichoderma ressei,"Trichoderma reesei is an industrially important filamentous fungus secreting extensive cellulases. Stability of secreted cellulases in media is one of the key factors to show their maximum enzyme activity. Previous studies have recorded post-transcriptional modification in cellulaes by proteases in T. reesei. Among these proteases, the main extracellular protease in T. reesei is the Family Al, aspartic protease Trichodermapepsin (TrAsP). Furthermore, with the increasing of TrAsP in culture media, cellulases decrease. This relationship suggests that they have a differential regulation system. However, there is an exhaustive information of environmental signal transduction mechanism for cellulase regulation in transcriptional level but the knowledge of transcriptional regulation of TrAsP is in infancy. The aim of this study is the elucidation of transcriptional regulation of TrAsP and discerning relationship between cellulase and protease regulation mechanism in T. reesei. In order to elucidate environmental signal transduction regulation mechanism for TrAsP expression in T. reesei, effect of carbon, nitrogen and pH were analyzed by protein expression and transcriptional analysis. Galactose was found as the best carbon source for TrAsP expression. In addition, TrAsP was induced by organic nitrogen and acidic pH in galactose medium. But, when addition of the galactose to organic nitrogen sources induction media trsap expression was found to be much lower compared to expression with the individual nitrogen sources alone. This result suggests that a novel transcriptional regulation mechanism exists in T. reesei for the protease regulation. The environmental responsive transcription factors were identified in T. reesei as following as carbon responsive; Xyrl and Crel, nitrogen responsive; AreA and pH responsive; Pac1. To analyze the effect of the above transcription factors for TrAsP regulation, SDS-PAGE, protease activity and qRT-PCR were carried out using deleting mutants of QM9414. As a result, Crel and Pacl behaved as repressors and AreA as an activator for TrAsP regulation. Surprisingly Xyrl acted as a repressor for trasp in spite of the main cellulase activator. Therefore, Xyr1 distruptant was selected for microarray analysis to ascertain the relationship between cellulase and protease regulation. Both Avicel and galactose mediums, Xyrl acted as a repressor for TrAsP. Consequently, this study showed that the differential transcriptional regulation mechanism of proteases exists compared to known regulation mechanisms of cellulases in T. reesei.",,,
7,ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT RESPONSE AND LIPID PRODUCTION IN THE OLEAGINOUS YEAST Rhodosporidium toruloides,"Oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides can produce high amounts of lipid (Triacylglycerol) from monosaccharides. In the optimal condition, lipid in R. toruloides occupy over 70 % of dry cell weight and lipid compositions of R. toruloides are similar to that of oleaginous plants. Therefore, lipid made from R. toruloides would solve various problems in Japan that the low degree of self-sufficiency in edible oil and dependence on imported lipid, etc. In addition, R. toruloides can also produce an antioxidative compound, carotenoid. Carotenoid is a group of valuable molecules for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and feed industries. It has been reported that carotenoid production in microorganism improved by light. But it has not been revealed that carotenoid biosynthesis mechanism is controlled by light. R. toruloides NBRC 10032 strain indicates red colored colony phenotype only when it is irradiated by light, which suggests improvement of the productivity of carotenoid by light. Here we showed the elucidation of light responsive mechanism of R. toruloides NBRC 10032 strain and analyzed the relationship between carotenoid production and lipid production. As a result, carotenoid production was increased at maximum 5 times and dry cell weights were decreased by irradiation as compared with these from dark condition. Furthermore, it was clarified that increase of proportion of C18:1 that is excellent to oxidation stability in total fatty acids. From the expression analysis of genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis by qRT-PCR, it was revealed that they were overexpressed since 72 hours after irradiation. Because the cells were red colored phenotype at 24 hours by irradiative cultivation, their expression pattern within 24 hours was analyzed. Surprisingly, we revealed that genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis were overexpressed in 1 hour after irradiation and transcripts were disappeared. This result shows that R. toruloides has two-step light response mechanisms and demonstrates that R. toruloides received oxidative stress from light.",,,
7,ALYSIS OF RECOMBINANT Trichoderma reesei STRAINS EXPRESSING β-GLUCOSIDASE 1,"Cellulase-overproducing mutants of Trichoderma reesei have been considered prime sources of enzymes needed for the economic saccharification of pretreated cellulosic biomass. Cellulase of T. reesei, such as cellobiohydrolase (CBH), endglucanase (EGL) and B-glucosidase (BGL), have the synergic effect (Fig. 1). However, BGL activity had been found to be quite low in cellulase preparations from T. reesei. It was reported that specific activity of BGL1 of T. reesei (TrBGL1) and of Aspergillus aculeatus (AaBGL1) were 19 U/mg and 180 U/mg, respectively. Therefore, to develop the T. reesei strains appropriate for the saccharification of pretreated cellulosic biomass, we were trying to improve BGL activity of T. reesei by expressing AaBGL1. In previous study, we constructed JN11 strain expressing aabgl1 using xyn3 promoter that is low expression level. Furthermore, we constructed JN12 strain expressing aabgi1 using the cbh1 promoter that is the highest expression level in cellulase, and JN13 strain expressing aabg11 using the egl1 promoter that is the middle expression level (result 1). In this study, we analyzed the cellulase activity, cellulase genes expression levels and biomass saccharification of JN1 series. BGL activity of PC-3-7, JN11, JN12 and JN13 were 0.09 U/mg, 9,07 U/mg, 29,77 U/mg, 11.86 U/mg, respectively (result 2). The expression of aabg1 in JN1 strains was confirmed by RT-PCR (result 3). Saccharification tests indicated that JN11 and JN13 were appropriated for hydrothermal pretreated biomass and NaOH pretreated biomass, respectively (result 4).",,,
7,Analysis of the Transglycosylation Activity of BGILL in Trichoderma ressei,"In filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei that is a potent producer of cellulase, the expression of cellulase genes is inductive and observed in the presence of inducers. It has been believed that inducers of cellulases occur from cellobiose by transglycosylation activity of B-glucosidases (BGL), however the detailed analysis has not been well investigated. And, it is reported that sophorose that is potent inducer in T. reesei is also produced by transglycosylation activity. T reesei mutant PC-3-7, derived from standard strain QM9414, has enhanced productivity by cellobiose. From the result of comparative genomics analysis, it is revealed to mutate one of intracellular BGL, BGLII, in PC-3-7. When this mutation was recovered, cellulase productivity on cellobiose was decreased. So it suggested that mutation of BGL|| involves in potent productivity of PC-3-7. In this presentation, to clarify functions of BGLII on induction of cellulase and impacts on transglycosylation activity by mutated BGLII, So we focus on 409th amino acid residue that mutated point of BGLII in PC-3-7, and we show mutation analysis by bg 2 that is substituted Val into other 19 kinds of amino acids.",It is comfirmed expression of recombinant BGLII that substituted aliphatic and small or tiny size amino acid for 409th residue. It is suggested potentiality that transglycosylation products of V409S and V409T include powerful inducer of cellulase.,,
7,Identification of the novel pH-responsive cellulase regulating factor in filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei,"Filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei produces a variety of cellulases and hemicellulases to degrade lignocellulose into monosaccharides. Many high cellulase-producing mutant strains of T. reesei have been developed by mutagenesis around the world. Among them, The Japanese high cellulaseproducing mutant PC-3-7 strain has been obtained from the global standard QM9414 strain. We have identified 54 genes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with mutation of amino acid in gene coding region between the wild type QM6a strain of T. reesei and its mutant strains. Previously, we were tried to characterize the effects of pH on cellulase production of mutant strains. We revealed that QM9414 strain shows the highest cellulase production under lower pH condition, while N-25 strain, derived from QM9414 strain, has higher pH-dependent cellulase productivity. There were 9 genes derived from SNPs between QM9414 and N-25. Therefore, it was considered cellulase productivity was altered by these SNP genes in N-25 strain. In this study, we aimed to identify the factor which related in pH-dependent cellulase production. we analyzed cellulase gene expression under the various pH conditions in Japanese mutants. This result suggested pH-dependent cellulase productivity of N-25 strain was reduced by low protein secretion. To elucidate the SNP that related in pH-dependent cellulase production, deletants of 9 SNP gene from QM9414 strain were constructed and analyzed pH-dependent cellulase production under the various pH conditions. As a result, two deletants (gene annotated transmembrane protein and a/B-hydrolase) decreased cellulase productivity under the lower pH conditions like N-25 strain. Furthermore, the N-25 expressed each wild type protein could not produce cellulase and hemicellulase under the lower pH conditions, while the mutant expressed both wild type protein was acquired cellulase productivity. Therefore, these results suggested that both genes were related in lower pH-dependent cellulase secretion.",Identified the novel lower pH-dependent cellulase regulating factors Lower pH : Activation of cellulase secretion by MFS transporter and α/β-hydrolase Higher pH : Repression of cellulase expression by other SNP protein,,
7,Functional analysis of C terminal-tail of putative trancepter CRT1 involved in lignocellulase production in Trichoderma reesei,"Trichoderma reesei is one of the most efficient lignocellulolytic fungi and it produces various lignocellulose-degrading enzymes called as lignocellulases. Lignocellulase secretion of T. reesei is dramatically activated when it is cultivated on cellulose as a sole carbon source. However, it is still unknown in detail how T. reesei recognizes lignocellulose existing on outer cell. Membrane proteins such as transporter show the important role in sugar uptake and recognition in yeast and filamentous fungi. Recently, trancepter that is a group of membrane protein has been identified in some filamentous fungi, and mostly involves in lignocellulase induction. From the analysis of several transporters induced by cellulose, it was revealed that deletion of putative trancepter CRT1 lead complete loss of lignocellulase production by cellulose. In addition, expression amount of CRT1 was extremely higher than that of the other transporter genes. Furthermore, localization analysis suggested that CRT1 was cleaved between transmembrane domain and C terminal-tail region. Therefore, it is speculated that C terminal-tail of CRT1 is involved in the signaling for lignocellulase induction. In this study, the purpose is to elucidate the signaling mechanism of C terminal-tail of CRT1 for lignocellulase induction. To analyze the function of C terminal-tail, we constructed various strains producing a deletion series of C terminal-tail. Although, transformant that deleted full length of C terminal-tail (residues 1-466) had no lignocellulase productivity. Transformants of partial deletion of C terminal-tail (residues 1-472, 1-486 and 1-498) could produce lignocellulases in the presence of cellulose. These results indicate that C terminaltail involves in lignocellulase production. Furthermore, it is also suggested that a region between 466 and 472 is important part of CRT1 for its function. To analyze the localization of CRT1 in the cell, GFP fused C terminal-tail expression strain (residues 466-510-GFP) was expressed. In fluorescence observation of this strain, was present in cytoplasm unlike GFP fusion CRT1 expression strain under lignocellulase induction condition. This result suggests that intracellular localization of CRT1 is not depending on C terminal-tail.",,,

7,STUDY OF TUNGSTEN FUZZ STRUCTURE GENERATION BY ATMOSPHERIC PLASMA,"Tungsten material is expected as one candidate for plasma facing wall materials of nuclear fusion reactors. It is known that fuzz structure [1,2] is formed on the surface when a tungsten material is irradiated with helium plasma. Kajita et al. [3] clarified that the fuzz formed tungsten material works as a nearly perfect light absorber for the near infrared region from the visible region. It is expected as a solar absorber of the next-generation solar power system. In this research, therefore, we aim to produce a fuzz structure by atmospheric plasma in order to produce the fuzz structure in low cost. Schematic drawing of the experimental equipment used this study is shown in Fig. 1. In this device, 2.45 GHz microwave is generated by the magnetron. The microwave propagates inside the waveguide, and reflects at the end of the waveguide. As a result, a standing wave is generated by superimposing the incident wave and the reflected wave. When the helium gas passes through the nozzle, the gas is ionized by the standing wave, and a plasma jet is generated. As a result of electrostatic probe measurement the electron temperature is approximately 2.5 eV when the microwave power is 600 W and the gas flow rate is 2 L/min. A tungsten sample is irradiated by helium plasma jet. After the irradiation, We observed the surface of the specimen by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). After the helium plasma irradiation in atmospheric pressure, the color of the surface of the specimen turns yellowish green, although it is known that the color turns black when the fuzz structure is generated by vacuum plasma. Figure 2 shows the SEM image of the surface of the specimen. Fibrous structure similar to the fuzz structure is observed. We also found the tungsten trioxide on the surface by energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDS).",,,

Milling tool was clectro deposed micro tool which has diamond abrasive grain on the tool tip. Fig.2 shows laser microphotograph of micro groove processed by proposed method. Results of this experiment, the groove width was 13.9um and the groove depth was lum. The aim of depth of 50nm could not be realized because contact detection accuracy between the tool and the workpiece is low.",,,

Thus, utilizing ICT(Information and Communication Technology) to agricultural area against those problems is expected. Quantifying meteorological data, optimization of the cultivating environment of crops would become easy and productivity would be improved. However, introduction to medium-sized farmers is difficult due to expensiveness of conventional meteorological observing module. Therefore, we aimed to develop meteorological observing system which is low-priced, high precision, low power, stable, and small in order to solve such a problem. We named this meteorological observing system ""Weather Station.""","It is necessary to prepare a certain measuring condition.

In solution, the equilibrium between the enantiomers is fast, and the enantiomers could not be distinguished (Fig2). In order to bias the helical handedness of aromatic layered ureas (Fig3), we synthesized aromatic ureas bearing a chiral substituent on the central benzene ring, and investigated the conformations in solution by 1H NMR, UV and CD spectra.","In the CD spectra, weak positive signal at 210-230 nm was observed for compounds 1 and 3, and strong negative signal at 220-270 nm was observed for compound 5, which indicated that the helical handednesses were biased to one side by the introduction of chiral substituents. Compounds 1, 3 and 5 possess chiral substituent with aromatic ring, so aromatic substituent seems to work on chiral induction of helical handedness of aromatic layered ureas.",,

9,PROFILE ANALYSIS OF SINGLE DISCHARGE CRATER USING GREEN COMPACT,"In the electrical discharge machining, in order to clarify the machining mechanism, the single electrical discharge crater formed on the machined surface by a single electrical discharge is analyzed such as the diameter and the depth. However, it is difficult to observe the melted and re-solidified region and measure the volume. In this research, an analytical method of the single electrical discharge crater using green compact to enable detailed profile measurement and analysis in a short time was proposed. The experimental method is shown in Fig. 1. Pure iron having a particle size of 1 um was placed in a cylindrical metal container, and a green compact was produced by a hydraulic press. A single electrical discharge was carried out on the green compact, and a single electrical discharge crater was taken out and the profile was measured. The observation results of the single electrical discharge crater formed in the green compact are shown in Fig. 2. The discharge crater formed in the green compact had a larger removal volume than those formed on pure iron plates. It is considered to be due to the thermal conductivity of the green compact is smaller than that of the bulk.

In recent years, environmentally-friendly and high energy conversion efficiency methods for the nano-materials synthesis have attracted attention. Pulsed wire discharge : PWD Pulsed wire discharge (PWD) is a method for Generation of plasma Formation of powder producing nanosized powders using metal Rapid Heating Evaporation Rapid Cooling vapor/plasma. In this method, the vapor/plasma is produced by Joule heating of thin wire due to a pulsed current. The vapor/plasma is rapid cooled by ambient gas or liquid, and it foms nanosized powders.

9,Effect of calcium salt on reactivity of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) with fluoride ion,"Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) reacts with fluoride ion in an aqueous solution and forms stable fluorapatite (FAP). This reaction is applied to setting and hardening reaction of dental phosphate cement. We have developed novel applications of this reaction to the environmental applications such as water treatment. In this case, release of phosphate ion from the reaction of DCPD is serious problem because phosphate cause to eutrophication of the water environments. In this study, we investigated novel treatment reagent based on DCPD mixed with calcium salts. Release of phosphate is consisting in two steps, dissolving of DCPD and release from reaction of DCPD. We found that release of phosphate from the former step was able to control by addition of soluble calcium salt such as calcium chloride. For the later step, addition of calcium carbonate was applicable because value of pH was controlled to around 8 by dissolution of it.",,,

9,Studies on the frame width with a real-time DOA estimation method,"We have proposed a framewise DOA (direction of arrival) estimation method for speech signals. The proposed method can be effective for moving sound source tracking. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between DOA estimation and frame width. In order to find the relationship, several simulations were carried out in a virtual room under the reverberation time RT60=200[msec] and the signal-to-noise ratio SNR=30dB. The experiment environment is shown in Fig. 1. The target sound source was located at a distance of 0.5[m] from the center of two microphones, changing its direction from 30° to 0o and from -30° to 0°. For the target sound sources, female speeches chosen from a Japanese speech corpus were employed as the dry source for generating the convolved mixtures. White Gaussian noise with zero mean was used for stationary ambient noise. The convolved mixtures were sampled at 8[kHz] with 16[bit) resolution and were transformed by STFT (short time discrete Fourier transform) with 64[msec) or 32[msec] frame width, 16[msec) or 8[msec] frame shifts and Hamming window.

9,DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL SENSITIVE FISH BY USING CLICK CHEMISTRY,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used for visualization of microorganisms [1]. However, the signal intensity of FISH depends on the amount of rRNA. Catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD)-FISH was developed to detect microorganisms with low rRNA contents. However, CARD-FISH is necessary to penetrate large enzyme in a cell. Thus, it may be difficult to detect microorganisms with low probe permeability [2]. Recently, quick Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) -FISH, which does not use the enzyme reaction for signal amplification, was reported to solve this problem [3]. In this study, we introduce the novel sensitive FISH with a combination of quickHCR-FISH and click chemistry. Click chemistry is a specific reaction with alkyne and azide. Thus, we try to use three alkyne-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and azide-labeled initiator probe for increasing the origin of signal amplification by HCR. Firstly, alkyne and AlexaFluor555 labeled probe was used to determine the specific hybridization. As a result, the positive signals were obtained from target cells (Fig.1). After that, azide and AlexaFluor555 labeled initiator probes, which have an initiator sequence for HCR reaction, was used for click chemistry. However, the signal was obtained from non-targeted cells (Fig.2). Thus, we are optimizing the alkyne-azide binding conditions in cell. After developing this method, the detection of microorganisms may be easier compared to other sensitive FISH.",,,

This method is used for thermal characterization in optical excitation. First of all, we have made several glass samples with different additive amount of Cu20. The composition of samples is as follows: 205n0-40ZnO-40P2O5+xCu2O; x=0.5~2.0 (mol%). After that, we conducted fluorescence lifetime and time resolved PTD measurements. In addition, we investigated influence of additive amount of Cu20 on light-emitting and thermal characteristics. Figure 1 shows schematic of PTD measuring system. Figure 2 shows a result of time resolved PTD measurement. The vertical line shows PTD signal intensity of samples: Iptd (arbitrary unit) and the horizontal one time (ms). As a result, the increase of additive amount of Cu20 did not lead to the increase of fluorescence lifetime. However, rise time and time constant in time resolved PTD measurement tended to extend. Therefore, amount of Cu20 has an influence on delay of heat propagation speed.",,,

Solutions containing large numbers of bubbles are made by vigorous mixing of gas and water, and the generated microbubbles of which diameter are less than 50 um shrink in water, then disappear or remain as nanobubbles within 1 um. Fine bubbles of various gases such as N2, H2, O2 and 03 have been attracted due to their widespread applications in industry, life science, and agriculture such as waste water treatment, sterilization, activation of plants, and so on. In this report, we would like to present a trial to incorporate air fine bubbles into polymer gel in order to obtain new performance of fine bubbles. Air fine bubbles were generated in deionized water with and without NaCl and their solutions of sodium alginate by the gas-water circulation metho (Jinno co., ZBaburer). The microbubbles were observed by the microscope (Motic co., EcolineTM D-EL2) as shown in Fig.1 and their size distributions were evaluated as shown in Fig.2. The number of smaller size microbubbles increases with increasing the concentration of NaCl from 0 to 3 wt%. In addition, large numbers of microbubbles with various sizes were observed in the aqueous solution of 3 wt% NaCl and 0.5 wt% sodium alginate. However, almost all microbubbles disappeared after 1 day even in the calcium alginate gel which was synthesized by dropping the sodium alginate solution containing microbubbles into 1 wt% calcium lactate aqueous solution.",,,

For the first point, it is hydroponic culture. The hydroponic culture is technique to cultivate only in culture fluid without using soil. Table 1 shows merits and demerits of hydroponic culture. In comparison with conventional plant cultivation, it attended that growth rate is fast. However, debasement of water quality is occurred easily because culture fluid is used. Nitric acid ions necessary for the growth of the plant is included in the culture fluid. Generally, for a method to maintain the water quality, drugs are used. However, keeping of the water quality using drugs only delays debasement and exchange of the water is necessary afterwards. It attended to use plasma for property modification of the water. It is because it has a removal effect of an organic substance using plasma. In addition, a few nitric acid ions are generated using the plasma underwater. The plasma generated in water which generates a few nitric ions into water, it can improve water quality and give plants the necessary nutrition for growth of these. However, there is not result of plasma irradiated to water surface. In this study, an effect of plasma irradiated to water surface is analyzed.

9,Water Modification for Hydroponic Culture Using Corona Discharge with Bubbling Underwater,"Plant cultivation from the factory is one of the most attractive industries in recent world. In the plant cultivation technology, hydroponic culture approach has several merits compared with conventional plant cultivation ways. Table 1 shows merits and demerits of hydroponic culture. However, debasement of water quality has been frequently occurred because the water contains several nutrients, which can be used for several organisms. Therefore, to keep water quality for plant cultivation, frequent water exchange must be required. In this study, it attended to use plasma for property modification of the water. It is because it has a removal effect of an organic substance using plasma. In addition, a few nitric acid ions are generated using the plasma underwater. The plasma generated in water contains a few nitric acid ions, it can improve water quality and give plants the necessary nutrition for growth of these. The using power supply for corona discharge underwater is shown in figure 1. This power supply is possible to generate corona discharge at atmospheric pressure. However, permittivity of water is high, the breakdown is not easy. Therefore air bubbles are generated near electric discharge electrodes using a diffusor. It is easy to generate plasma underwater. Plasma will be generated this system using this power supply for corona discharge in underwater and the water quality and nitric acid ion concentration is evaluated.",,,

Since, there are few effective uses development of utilizing techniques of recovered reed is required. In this study, as one of the effective utilizations of Phragmites, we used it as a substitute for sawdust for mushroom medium. Cultivation test was carried out using oyster mushroom, cloud ear mushroom with different properties.","In this study, we examined the application of Phragmites to mushroom cultivation as one of the effective utilizations of Phragmites.

9,Development of resource circulation for fermented bagasse and brown sugar shochu lees by cultivation of cloud ear mushroom,"This study deals with the cultivation of cloud ear mushroom (Auricularia polytricha) using two food industrial wastes as culture media: fermented bagasse and brown sugar shochu lees in Amami, one of the southwest islands in Japan. The brown sugar shochu lees generated from brewing shochu is mostly sprinkled on the sugar cane field, increasing the amount of potassium in the soil. The excessive amount of potassium is likely to lower the sugar production by cane. The bagasse after extracting sugar has been used as source for heating boiler. We tested the brown sugar shochu lees as a nutrient supplement for cloud ear mushroom cultivation, and compared it with the more commonly used rice bran. In addition, we compared the fermented bagasse as a base material and compared it with broad-leaved tree sawdust. The bagasse was fermented inside for 2 months.Table 1 summarizes the compositions of media used in this trial. These two wastes were found to be better as the mushroom media than the conventional media. The fruit bodies obtained from the media could be judged to be a local special product because they were rich in dietary fiber and B-glucan. By the strong absorbing ability of potassium, 30% of potassium was removed from the starting media by the mushroom. The results suggest that the potassium amount in the agricultural field will be reduced when the waste media are sprinkled in exchange for the brown sugar shochu lees.",,,
9,Study of Shielding Method to Reduce Leakage Magnetic Fields of an Opening in a Magnetically Shielded Room,"Magnetic noise is generated by transmission line and movement of magnetic material.Fig.1 shows magnetic noise generating source. However, precision instruments are often affected by a magnetic noise. Therefore, these precision instruments must use a magnetically shielded room (MSR) to reduce magnetic noise. Fig.2 shows the magnetically shielded room (MSR) . The MSR typically consists of multiple shielding layers, with openings in a wall and the floor to allow for ventilation, wiring, and plumbing connections. However, magnetic noise can leak into the MSR from those openings, and anything inside can be influenced by it.","The purpose of this study was to examine the most suitable shape for a partition plate to be installed in the opening of an MSR consisting of multiple shielding layers. The dependencies of the leakage magnetic field distribution on the length of the partition plate installed in the duct and the number of plate divisions were analyzed using a 3-dimensional magnetic field analysis by finite element method. The study yielded the following results. (1) Magnetic noise from outside the MSR was reduced by using a partition plate. (2)The shielding performance of magnetic noise in the horizontal direction (x axis) was good as the partition plate was longer in any number of divisions. (3) In the case of cell width was small, magnetic noise in the vertical direction (y axis) was effectively reduced when the length of the partition plate was approximately 50% of the width of the cell. conversely, the length of the partition plate must be increased when the cell width was large.",,
9,Application of an Effective Ultrasonic Buffer Rod Probe to Molten Polymer Monitoring,"In order to monitor plastic resin molding, we have attempted to apply ultrasonic pulse-echo measurement to molten polymer resin (low density polyethylene: LDPE) with polygonal buffer rod. We utilized polygonal buffer rod made of polyimide, which is to be referred to as waveguide, in order to reduce trailing echoes interrupting appropriate pulse-echo measurement, and polyimide offers good acoustic impedance matching between the polymer and buffer rod. Therefore, the polygonal buffer rod provides fine pulse-echo waveform as shown in Fig. 2 when a tip of the rod of 115 mm is immersed into the molten LDPE at around 470 K. Ultrasonic velocity and attenuation of the LDPE at molten and solid states is measured to evaluate its property. It showed that the velocity decreases in solid state as temperature increases, despite of the increase of attenuation liquid state. Interface of solid/liquid phase during solidification is moreover observed by the development of echoes from the interface. Therefore, the availability of ultrasonic buffer rod is demonstrated for the monitoring of molten polymer.",,,
9,EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF ULTRASONIC ON ALUMINUM DEEP DRAWING PROCESS,"The damage zone on the die surface in deep drawing process are mainly caused by the friction force between sheet metal and the die. Lubrication is therefore used to reduce the friction force. However, the use of lubrications has been restricted due to environmental concerns. This study will investigate the contribution of ultrasonic vibration to reduce the shearing stress by reducing the friction force between ceramics die and the worksheet. In the current work, experimental investigations on the effect of ultrasonic vibration on aluminum deep drawing process were carried out.

9,Development of ceramic structure control method with DC and pulsed electric field,"Electrochemistry of non-aqueous solution is a chemistry to deal electron transfer between materials in non-aqueous solutions and various phenomena associated with it. By using appropriate non-aqueous solvent or a mixed solvent other than water, it becomes possible to cause a new reactions or purpose reactions by material's dissolved state and the reactivity changes. Furthermore, electro-rheological (ER) fluid is a functional fluid application that the rheological properties change by applying an electric field. This paper is intended to develop a new ceramic structure control method by combining the electrochemical of non-aqueous and the ER fluid. The main purpose of this study is a driving control of micro-structure by electric field. In particular, the drive control of the micro-structure in a non-aqueous solution to control from the outside by the electric field, are considering applications such as metering pump in the non-aqueous solution. In this study, we investigated the behavioral mechanisms of the inorganic material in non-aqueous solution when an electric field is applied. When a DC electric field is applied to the ZrO2 balls in the polysiloxane solution, repetitive motion between the electrodes on an irregular interval was observed. In this repetitive motion, ZrO2 balls is moved to the opposite polarity of the electrodes by the time elapsed from the beginning to the contact with the electrode. It has conducted a survey from the point of view of the electrochemical of non-aqueous solutions and electrophoresis for the mechanism of this repetitive motion.",,,

In this research, the underwater shock wave is generated by applying high voltage to the metal thin wire in underwater, and the metal plate is transformed to a predetermined shape. The experimental device for metal forming is shown in Figl. Experimental device is constituted by the pressure vessel and the blank holder and the die, using a copper plate with a thickness of 0.5mm, diameter of 140mm. Numerical simulations were performed using ALE (Arbitrary LaGrangian Eulerian)method[1]. Explosive and water Euler area, the metal plate and the vessel were simulated as Lagrange area. From this simulation, the process propagation of the underwater shock wave and deformation process of the metal plate were confirmed. Forming shape of copper plate is shown in Fig 2. As a result of having performed shape measurement of the test pieces after the experiment, test pieces were formed as the shape of the curved surface that the height is maximum in the center. The whole test piece has become thinner. In addition, the thickness strain of the center was larger. Also, I understand that magnitude of the charging voltage affects the forming amount from Fig 2.

9,Durability of Resist Film in TMAH Developer Analyzed by C-V Method,"Recently, pattern development in Tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solution has been focused on the point of precise pattern shape control.[1,2] In the pattern development process, one major drawback in pattern fabrication is that the whole resist film mass swells by absorbing developer. In this study, we focus on the developer intrusion as the simple diffusion model. In this regard, the C-V property of MIS structure is sensitive to the bulk and interface nature of the dielectric layer.[3] We present effective results for intrusion analysis of TMAH developer by sensing with the C-V property. In the experiment, MIS(metal insulator semiconductor) structure, as shown in Fig.1, was fabricated by the semiconductor device processes. The resist layer of 2.91um thick was interposed with Au electrode and p-type Si(100) substrate. In Fig.2, the measurement system of C-V test sample was shown. A liquid drop of TMAH developer was set on the comb type electrodes and intruded into the resist film. Figure 3 shows a typical C-V curve of MOS structure. As an oxide layer, a tantalum oxide can be employed. A slight curve shift due to negative ion such as Cl- contain can be observed. Figure 4 shows a C-V curve measured with a function of dipping time of TMAH developer. As a result, the capacitance of MIS sample increased, and a curve shift toward negative bias, which is relatively large compared with MOS structure in Fig.3, can be confirmed. It can be considered that the capacitor increase reflects the TMAH intrusion because of its higher ionic conductivity. The C-V curve shift reflects the existence of positive ion (TMAH ionic matter) in the resist layer. On the contrary, no curve change can be observed in the deionized (DI)-water dipping experiment. Moreover, capacitance change of resist film by set on a DI-water become large due to higher relative dielectric constant of DI-water. In this way, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the C-V method for analyzing TMAH developer intrusion into the resist film. The C-V system in this study becomes a new functional sensing device contributing to electrochemical field.",,,
9,A Bacterial Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Effective for the 9 Syringyl-Type Lignin Utilization,"Lignin is the second most abundant biological material on earth after cellulose, and its decomposition is an essential step for carbon cycling. Softwood lignin typically consists of only guaiacyl units, while Hardwood are composed of similar levels of guaiacyl and syringyl units. Syringaldehyde (SALD) and vanillin (VN) are abundantly generated by chemical and thermal depolymerization of lignin. On the other hand, it is known that some bacteria capable of catabolizing these compounds using various enzymes in a specific pathway. Therefore, in the combination of physicochemical and biological processes, SALD and VN are considered as useful starting compounds to produce chemicals, such as 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid, cis,cismuconic acid, and polyhydroxyalkanoate, which can be used for the production of industrially valued polymers. To date, the VN dehydrogenase gene (vdh) has been extensively studied in various bacteria. However, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) capable of catalyzing oxidation of SALD is limited. Moreover, their activities toward SALD are very weak compared to VN used as substrate. Sphingobium sp. SYK-6, an alpha proteobacterium, has an ability to grow on diverse lignin-derived aromatic compounds, including SALD and VN (Masai et al., Review of Biosci Biotechnol Biochem, 2007). We have identified a VN dehydrogenase gene, ligV in a previous study (Masai et al., Biosci Biotechnol Biochem, 2007b). However, disruption of ligV scarcely affected the growth of SYK-6 on SALD, and suggested that an alternative ALDH gene is involved in the conversion of SALD in SYK-6.","A novel SALD dehydrogenase gene, des V which plays a critical role for the SALD catabolism in Sphingobium sp.

9,Characterization of rubber degradation by a Rhodococcus rubber degrader,"Rubber waste such as scrap tires causes environmental burden and requires environmental conscious treatment. Microbial decomposition of rubber is expected to be a future treatment technique after improvement of degradation enzyme system. In addition, rubber degrading enzyme is expected to be used in chemical modification of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) to form a new polymer. In order to establish an advanced rubber-degradation system, a rubber-degrading consortium, named E, was enriched from the wastes of a rubber processing factory in Vietnam. The Rhodococcus sp. strain E2 was isolated from E consortium as a sole rubber degrader among other isolates. The gene responsible for the initial step of rubber degradation, lep was identified in the genome sequence of strain E2. To investigate the rubber-degradation activity, the lep gene of E2 was cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The purified Lcp protein decomposed poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in the deproteinized-natural-rubberoverlay agar plates to low molecular aldehyde intermediates. When purified Lcp protein was incubated with the synthetic rubber in vitro, synthetic rubber polymer was degraded to the low-molecular-weight intermediates, which was revealed by gel permeation chromatography. These results indicated that the Lcp innately degrades poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) to low-molecularweight aldehyde intermediates and is responsible for rubber degradation in strain E2. Many oxidative enyzme genes were found in the genome of strain E2 as the candidates for further oxidation of aldehyde intermediate. However, the metagenomic analysis based on 16S rRNA of rubber-degrading consortium E with addition of strain E2 throughout 3 months-incubation revealed this strain is minor component in whole samples. This result suggested that the consortium employed the alternative enzyme(s) from major components other than from E2, in order to contribute the oxidation of Lcp-generated intermediates.","• Rhodococcus sp. E2 was isolated as a strong rubber degrader. The gene reponsible for rubber degradation was identified in E2 genome. • Lcp_E2 showed innate activity to degrade poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) using oxygen consumption and generates aldehyde-intermediates. Lcp itself degrades rubber on plate, but indirectly responsible for clearing-zone on rubber-overlay plate. Further oxidation of intermediates by additional enzymes maybe required for clearing-zone observation. • Rubber degrading bacteria/consortia may use alternative enzyme(s) other than oxiAB-coding enzyme for rubber degradation. These enzymes appeared to be distributed in also non-rubber degrader. This is consistent with the minority of rubber degrader E2 in rubberdegrading consortium. • Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 carrying lop_E2 acquired ability to grown on DPNR-overlay plate even aldehyde accumulation was not detected.",,
9,Elucidation of transcriptional regulation of genes associated with lignin-derived aromatics degradation in bacteria,"Lignin is the most abundant aromatic biomass in nature, and development of technology for its effective utilization as biomass is expected to highly contribute to the creation of a recycling society. However, because lignin is a complex, heterogeneous, and random phenolic polymer, the beneficial use of lignin is extremely limited. Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 is a unique bacterium capable of utilizing various types of lignin-derived aromatics, which are degraded via vanillate (VA) and syringate (SA). In SYK-6, VA is further converted to protocatechuate (PCA) by VA O-demethylase (LigM), and then PCA is metabolized through the PCA 4,5-deavage pathway. SA is initially transformed to 3-0-methylgallate (3MGA) by SA O -demethylase (DesA). The resulting 3MGA is catabolized through multiple ring cleavage pathways involving PCA 4,5 -dioxygenase (LigAB), 3MGA 3,4-dioxygenase (DesZ), and gallate (GA) dioxygenase (DesB). Among these pathways, the route via GA involving LigM and DesB plays a crucial role in the growth of SYK-6 on SA. Our research group has discovered that 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate (PDC) produced in the VA and SA catabolic pathways is useful in the production of biodegradable and high functional polymers, such as strong adhesives and biodegradable films. The production of PDC from lignin-derived aromatics would be a promising strategy for the effective utilization of lignin. To date, the SYK-6 pathway genes for VA and SA have been well characterized, however, the transcriptional regulation of these genes remains unknown with exception of the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway genes. In order to establish processes for the effective utilization of lignin, it is essential to understand both microbial catabolic genes for the degradation of lignin-derived aromatics and the transcriptional regulation of the catabolic genes.",,,

Sphingobium sp. strain SYK6 is able to catabolize various lignin-derived aromatic biaryls, including B-aryl ether, diarylpropane, biphenyl, and phenylcoumaran. Therefore, the catabolic genes for lignin-derived aromatics of SYK-6 have a high potential for the lignin utilization.",,,
9,ESTIMATION OF DETACHING STRENGTH BASED ON FLUFFING RESISTANCE MODEL FOR PEELED LAYER OF WHITE-COATED PAPERBOARD,"The delamination mechanism is important for making the crease forming. The evaluation of delamination strength is necessary for estimating the folding performance of locally delaminated crease, and also the peeling mechanism is necessary for knowing the peeling performance of zipper tag. In order to inspect the strength of delamination, such as the peeling test is examined. The internal bonding strength is a dominant factor affecting the delamination behavior of crease folding as shown in Fig.1. In this work, an internal breaking criteria and transient delamination of a weak bonded layer of paperboard was experimentally investigated through a peel cohesion test (PCT) and its detaching resistance was estimated as a fluffing model using a finite element method (FEM) code, in order to characterize the peeling deformation of weak bonded layer as shown in Fig.2. The relationship between the pulling force and curvature of delaminated upper layer of the paperboard were discussed, also the anaphase yielding resistance of detaching was analyzed through ZDTT. The peeled deformation of PCT was analyzed using the isotropic elasticity FEM model which was developed through ring crush test.",,,
9,MUSHROOM CULTIVATION USING FERMENTED BAMBOO SAWDUST,"Moso bamboos over 5 years old decline their reproductive abilities. In Japan, most of these old bamboos are cut and left in forests, without any efficient uses but being charcoal or livestock feed. In this study, we conducted the experimental oyster mushroom cultivation using bamboo sawdust which had been fermented for 2 months as a base material in order to promote the Moso bamboos’ recycling. The total growth days on the bamboo media were 3~7 days shorter than those on the conventional media. Ohga et al, having had investigated the effects of the nucleic acid-related substances on edible mushrooms' mycelia, reported that they accelerated the mycelial growth. The fermented bamboo sawdust contained some nucleic acid-related substances generated from microorganisms, which resulted in the short cultivation term. The yield from the bamboo media was equal or more than that from the conventional media. The free- amino acids in the fruit bodies from the bamboo media were 1.5 times higher than those in the samples from the conventional media, which potentially add the higher value to usual mushrooms.",,,

Because they don't like boring lectures in a class room, but they like the experiments of Science. This situation restricts Japanese innovation. We make a new synthesizer (electrical instrument) as the countermeasure of it. The screen image is below in Fig.1, Fig.2 is the simplified block diagram of it. The purpose of the synthesizer is making children interested in the music and Scientific background i.e. programming, electric schematic diagram and Scientific story for example, how the sound moves. If some of them are interested in the Science and Technology, the probability of the increase of people who will lead Japanese innovation and make the base of Japanese industry in the future. The reason of the synthesizer is for children is there's no keyboard on it, children can write their own melody on it and it will be played without any settings. Because the function is in Raspberry pi 3, and it automatically scan the written line, and convert the line to the melody quickly. Additionally, we are planning to make the external MIDI sync function to sync many of them at the same time. This way of playing music is more familiar than usual keyboards and children can percept the musical scale easier than the other instruments. Because it's unnecessary to understand the relation between the musical scale and keyboard as the switches, they can write down the scale with their familiar stylus pen of NINTENDO DS series.",,,

11,Bed Variation and Its Control at a River Confluence Associated with the Upstream River Topography and Release of the Barrage,"The Kako River flows through Hyogo Prefecture. The influence of runoff due to barrage water and the Mino River tributary, combined with a meander in the river upstream from the large barrage on the Kako River (Kakogawa Barrage), has promoted the development of a sand bar on the river bank opposite the confluence. The sand bar, which has hardened, currently deflects the passage of water back to the left bank and has decreased the usable water surface area of the river. The objective of this study was to survey the river topography in the vicinity of the Mino River confluence and identify the factors responsible for sand bar development. In addition, movable-bed modeling of the channels at the tributary junction was performed to assess the influence of the barrage water and the river meander upstream on river flow, and to consider the effect of the spur dike installed for control of a sandbar. The numerical calculations were analyzed using the two-dimensional flow analysis software, Nays2DH, to verify the experimental results and to investigate how they can be applied.","(1) By considered the river meander upstream on river flow, the mechanisms responsible for sand bar development on the river bank opposite was clarified. And its factor is identified as the most dominant. (2) The development of a sandbar promoted by increasing for flow ratio(Q/Qm) and water level on downstream. (3) In the experiments with the spur dikes, the sand bar from the middle of confluence to the right bank is flashed by flow changes. The effect of control the sand bar is confirmed but the deal with local scouring is needed.

12,Research of Initial Corrosion Behavior of Stainless Steels in the Molten Pure Sn,"The occurrence of corrosion of stainless steel by molten lead-free solder has been a serious problem at flow soldering process. Although the corrosion mechanism has not yet clarified. Thus, the initial corrosion behavior of two stainless steels, SUS304 and SUS316, were examined in this study in order to understand the reaction mechanism between pure Sn and steels. Corrosion tests were kept times up to 1000 hours at 500 °C for SUS304 and 2000 hours for SUS316, respectively. After corrosion test, it was observed the cross-sectional reaction layers by OM and SEM and analyzed them by EPMA. After the corrosion test with flux for less than 500hr it is observed that an island like reaction layer formed on SUS304 locally. This layer showed the duplex structure consisting of external and internal layer, FeSn and FeSn2. And then, for 500hr island like reaction layer increased and it grew. Finally, the duplex structure developed by connections of these layers. The duplex layer grew in a parabolic law. On the other hands, after the corrosion test without flux for 500hr very thin layer, consisting of passive layer, Cr2O3, formed on SUS304. It is observed that another thin layer beneath Cr2O3 consist of Fe-Sn compounds. EPMA analysis showed the absence of chromium in the subscale and enrichment it in the external scale. And then for more than 750hr the thickness of scale increase and the scale has a duplex structure consisting of external and internal layer, FeSn and FeSn2. The thickness of duplex scale is almost the same as that of SUS304 specimens with flux. After the corrosion tests of SUS316 with flux for 1000hr, it is observed that the layer of FeSn compounds was formed under the passive film. And then, for 1500hr the reaction layer increased and it grew under the passive film. And for 2000hr, the reaction layer of duplex structure was formed like the case of SUS304. On the other hands, after the corrosion test without flux over 2000hr the reaction was not seen. From these results, SUS316 has highly ability of corrosion resistance than SUS304. the incubation time of SUS316 was longer than that of SUS304 because Mo included in SUS316 keep stable the passive film. After the passive film was removed, the reaction behavior of SUS316 was similar to that of SUS304.","In conclusion, there is the incubation time that does not occur the reaction of corrosion because the passive film prevent diffusion of substance. After the incubation time, Fe is dissolved in the Sn. And, the reaction layer that duplex structure of FeSn and FeSn2 is formed.",,

In a conventional method, the experimenter uses survey meter in a hand and scan the all over working desk. The experimenter, however, may be exposed to radiation in scanning. Besides, it is routine works for the experimenter to check the pollution every time at both pre and post of the experiment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a monitoring system for visualizing radiation dose distributions in a draft chamber through the use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Figure 1 shows demonstration for two radiation detectors. The number in Fig.1 is the parts used in this demonstration system. The system is composed of inexpensive detectors, a AR tag, a USB camera connected to a PC, PICs, and wireless modules. AIR COUNTERs are used as a compact radiation detector to measure radiation dose. The detectors are controlled by a PIC and the data is sent to the PC via a pair of ZigBee modules. The data is sent through wireless communication. The AR tag is laid on the monitoring area and is recognized as the base level to draw the chart based on the data. 3D-Graphics of the charts are overlaid on the images captured by the USB camera through recognition of the AR tag.

12,"Study on vitrification of coal ash: Quantity of flux (Na2CO3 , Na2B4O7) and melting of coal ash","The ash which is produced by combustion of coal is called coal ash. Its principal components are oxides of silicon and aluminum. In Japan, coal has been used in thermal power generation, and a large amounts of coal ash have been discharged from power plant. The coal ash is utilized as mixed material of concrete and asphalt. Recently, in Japan, the thermal power generation tends to be increasing, and discharges of the coal ash increase, too. From on now, it is expected that coal ash cannot be processed only by mixed materials of concrete and asphalt. We have considered using as glass material, which is one of the inorganic materials whose main components are oxides of silicon and aluminum. Especially, we have considered vitrifying coal ash under conditions at less than 1000 degrees Celsius, aiming at vitrification in general electric furnace. In this presentation, we report about action of flux (sodium carbonate: Na2CO3, sodium tetraborate: Na2B407) addition to the vitrification of coal ash. Element composition of coal ash was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) method. The coal ash was mixed with Na2CO3 (or Na2B407) in a mortar, put in alumina boat, and heated in electric furnace at 1000 degrees Celsius for 2 hours. This mixture was taken out after cooling. Then, its vitrification was found by checking whether the sample was melting or not. The coal ash used in this experiment had less amount of silicon, aluminum and sodium than general coal ash, and the amount of calcium was within the range of general coal ash. Also, it contained 46% of unburned carbon. The ratio of silicon and Coal ash aluminum was the same as general coal ash. The figure shows the picture of the coal Mixture ash and a mixture of coal ash and Na2CO3 flux before (A) and after (B) the heating in the electric furnace.

12,Differences in wood rot by Pleurotus cornucopiae var. citrinopileatus between Fagus crenata (Japanese beech) and Pinus luchuensis (Okinawa pine),"Recently, various biomass-conversion methods are needed for construction of recycling oriented society. For example, production of bio-fuels or chemicals from the forest resources is important. Those are regeneratable materials since wood biomass absorb carbon dioxide by the photosynthesis. But, it is necessary to remove lignin from wood for utilization of cellulose. Some methods for degradation of lignin have been researched. In this study, we focused on biological processing with the tamogitake (Pleurotus cornucopiae var. citrinopileatus), one of the white-rot fungi. Previous research revealed tamogitake could growth on both Fagus crenata and Pinus luchuensis. Generally, it is said that softwood is hardly utilized for making bio-fuels because degradation of its lignin is difficult. If we can degrade lignin in Pinus luchuensis efficiently, activated utilizing of forest resource in Okinawa island can be expected. Therefore, we aimed to clarify differences in wood-decay by tamogitake between Fagus crenata and Pinus luchuensis and to investigate efficient degradation of lignin of Pinus luchuensis. Ligninolytic enzymes extracted from decayed Pinus luchuensis were assayed weekly for 4 weeks. The major ligninolytic enzyme secreted tamogitake was laccase. The laccase activity peaked after 3 weeks in Pinus luchuensis medium. On the other hand, it peaked after 2 weeks in Fagus crenata medium[1]. Because of strong binding in lignin molecule or a large amount of lignin, it is suggested that laccase activity in decayed Pinus luchuensis peaked one week later than that in Fagus crenata medium.",,,
1,Nonparametric modeling based on estimated impulse response for acceleration control systems.,"Industrial automation by robots is indispensable for economic development. Recently, not only industrial robots but also various service robots are developed. We need to make

2,"Analysis of microbial community structure involved in the green
onion cultivation with soil improvement material (Hinai Green).","The demand of fresh-cut green onion as a condiment for cooking has increased in the world.
For Japan, China is the top import destination of the cut green onion, and the quality and cost of the
cut green onion are improving due to the introduction of the latest plant growing facility. Therefore,
cost-effective and higher productivity cultivation method has been required for domestic fresh-cut
green onion production. The cut green onion is generally cultivated in an open-field or hothouse. To
observe higher yields, ‘cut back’ is frequently applied, which leaves the roots and cuts the green onion
leaves on the ground at 2–3 times during cultivation. In this study, in order to further increase the
yields, we focused on ‘cut back’ technique. If we can increase the ‘cut back’ numbers, higher
productivity could be observed. Although chemical fertilizer is frequently used for cut green onion
cultivation, there are some problems such as frequent occurrence of soil disorder. Therefore, to
improve the root-associated and soil-effective microbial structures, we fertilized mixed organic
fertilizers into the green onion cultivating soils, which are mixed fermented mushroom waste and
fermented bamboo powder with ‘Hinai green’ (Towada Green-tuff AgroScience Co., Ltd) as soil
improvement material. ‘Hinai green’ is produced from Towada stone, which is a domestic natural
mineral resource, and the products is known as activator of symbiotic microbes in the soil and plants.
The final goals of this study are achievement of stable higher yield of green onion compared
with traditional cultivation way, and manualization of fertilizer application. To achieve these goals, we
attempt to elucidate microbial mechanisms such as mycorrhizae and soil-effective microorganisms
involved in the yield increase. By doing so, fertilizer application can be manualized for domestic
farmers to overcome the worldwide market competition.",,,
2,Phylogenetic analysis of nematodes causing lotus root disease.,"A lotus root is one of the unique domestic plant foods, which is yearly produced
approximately 59,990 t in Japan. During continuous cropping, plant-parasitic nematodes
frequently remain a major threat because of causing several diseases. Hirschmanniella imamuri
and H. diversa are known as major lotus root-parasitic nematodes, which cause melasma and
uneven surface (called as ‘ yuzuhada skin disease ’), respectively. To protect these diseases,
several approaches have been considered until now ( e.g. disinfection treatment of seed lotus
root, nematode test of fertilizer, and chemical disinfection in the field). However, because these
approaches require much efforts, additional cost, and damage to microbial community
structures in the field, development of further effective way is necessary for stable lotus root
production. In this study, we focused on the characteristics of genus Bacillus and non-parasitic
nematodes. Bacillus spp. are known as antibacterial effect for several pathogenic molds and
bacteria. It is also commercially available as a Bt insecticide, which can protect plants from
several pests. Besides, it is known that when Bacillus spp. are predominated in soil, abundance of
non-parasitic nematodes increase in soil. By focusing on these characteristics, we speculated
that the fertilizer containing predominant Bacillus spp. and non-parasitic nematodes can protect
lotus root from parasitic nematodes because antibiotics products from Bacillus spp. decrease
pests, and non-parasitic nematodes acquire new niche in the lotus root field.
Our final goal of this study is development of new fertilizing method for lotus root. In
previous our studies, we could make new fertilizer containing predominant Bacillus spp. and
non-parasitic nematodes, which could protect disease of potato from nematodes. Before
fertilizing our developed fertilizer into the lotus root filed, we investigated the distribution of
nematodes in the damaged field by parasitic nematodes targeting 18S rRNA gene sequences
using MiSeq (Illumina). In addition to 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we attempt to analyze
prokaryotic community compositions targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences and 18S rRNA gene
copy numbers of nematodes in the fields and fertilizers.",,,

button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) cultivation on it in order to put sewage sludge to
practical application for growing edible mushrooms. The yield from test groups with
only sewage sludge compost as the nutrient supplement was much less than that from
control groups with cow manure. It means that sewage sludge compost does not contain
enough cellulose and potassium for growing mycelia. On the contrary, the yield from
test groups with combined use of sewage sludge compost and cow manure was 1.2~1.8
times of that from the control groups. The amount of heavy metals, the main

CONDITION.","Marine industries are the prominent sector in developing countries recent days. One of those industry
types is the fishmeal production. The effluent of this industry contains strength wastewater with
extremely high salinity (325±150 mg-Cl - /L), protein (40±60 g-COD/L) and lipids (67±45 g-COD/L).
This wastewater is very difficult to treat with a conventional method so it requires more complex
pretreatments and resources. In this study, the application of Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR)
conducted as the alternative technology for the low input wastewater treatment system. This system
is known for its capability in treating high-concentration wastewater without control difficulties and
high operational cost. Besides that, the main characteristic of ABR is the multi compartmentalization
which benefits in separating several process phases include acidification and methanogenesis. The 60
L working volume pipe type ABR was installed in Technology Development Center at the Nagaoka
University of Technology. The reactor consists of 8 columns up and down with recirculation line in
the 5th column. It was operating with a 20-day hydraulic retention time (HRT) and manual feeding
with the influent of 3 L per day while effluent recirculated with the rate a 1:10 of fed water. After
operating for 340 days, ABR could achieve high performance in treating fishmeal processing effluent
wastewater with total COD removal around 97.6±1% and remaining content around 1.97±1 g-
COD/L. Meanwhile, the soluble COD removal could perform around 91.8±5% and 1.28±0.8 mg-
COD/L remain in effluent respectively. During the operation, the total ammonia in reactor increase
from 220±200 mg-N/L to 505±157 mg-N/L. This condition indicated that protein degradation
appears in the system process. In other hands, oil and grease degradation pathway in ABR indicated
by the appearance of scum and methane conversion. In this study, most of the oil and grease content
settled in the first column. It seems like the degradation still can be achieved for the 20 days HRT
without resistant to the system while 13.5±7.9 L per day methane gas produced during 340-day
operation or around 50 to 60% of total biogas. Finally, ABR has good performance compared to

1 and nitrate (NO
3
- ) concentration within 10 mg-N L -1 during 200 days of its operation. 1) Thus, reduced the
necessity to perform water exchange. Due to limited water exchange performed, accumulation of yellow
substances was observed over time, making water exchange obligatory despite color was innocuous and
cause no fatality threat to aquatic animals. In this study, we considered the application of ozone (O 3 ) in
combination with DHS-USB system to eliminate water exchange for aquaria. O 3 has capability to prevent
accumulation of yellow substances although removal of yellow substances was often hampered in presence
of NO 2 - . 2) The aim of this study is to demonstrate the suitability of Ozone-DHS-USB system in maintaining
aquaria’s water quality within freshwater breeding standard, NH 3 : 0.1, NO 2 - : 0.1 and NO 3 - : 10 (mg N L -1 )
for long term operation and aesthetic beauty as much as performing 50% water exchange. This study also
attempts to investigate the potential of Ozone-DHS-USB system as zero-water exchange system for on-site
aquaria.
The performance of the system was evaluated using on site freshwater aquaria (600 L) at ambient
temperature (20-34°C). DHS reactor has a volume of 80 L, sponge volume of 12 L and HRT of 0.015 h.
USB reactor has a volume of 8 L and HRT of 2.67 h. pH was maintained at 7-8. Short-term continuous
ozonation was operated at Phase 2 and 4 over a period of 8 h at constant O 3 concentration of 70 mg-O 3 h -1 .
During the time of study, DHS-USB system and carps (Cyprinus Carpio) remained in the aquaria. The NH 3 ,
NO 2 - , and NO 3 - concentration detected was 0.10 ± 0.12, 0.03 ± 0.13 and 6.40 ± 7.46 mg N L -1 respectively.
Color were maintained at 6 color units at phase 2 and 4 when O 3 was applied continuously for 8 h per day.
Continuous O 3 exposure for 8 h per day was sufficient to maintain clear water in aquaria below 10 color unit.
Re-application of O 3 reduced about 50% color unit from previous reading showed that O 3 can reduce color
as much as performing water exchange. Reduction in DHS reactor performance was not observed despite

from transformed organisms have attracted a lot of attention. Heterologous gene
expression systems have been developed using various organisms such as
microorganisms and higher animals. However, there are some problems such as
high-producing cost and difficulty of producing process. Therefore, we are
focusing on the earthworm, Eisenia fetida which can produce post-translational
protein modification, as a novel host and, are attempting to construct of
heterologous gene expression system using the earthworm. Since Eisenia fetida
has been approved as the model animal of acute toxicity test by Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it has been treated as a widely
studied material in the world. Furthermore, it has confirmed that the
earthworms can eat safely because we have already developed as a dietary
supplement [1]. If we use the earthworm as a recombinant host, we can uptake
the earthworms including recombinant proteins because of the reasons as
mentioned above. It is expecting that the developing genetic engineering
techniques is not only accelerating research as the OECD model organism but also
possibly a new model organism connecting between microorganisms and higher
animals. Furthermore, earthworms are known as heavy metal tolerance
organisms and its mechanisms are researching widely [2]. Therefore, genetic
engineering tools are not only useful for biomedicine production but also
elucidation of the mechanism of the gene from the viewpoint of improvement of
soil pollution. ? These tools can contribute to wide range research fields.? ?
However, since there were no reports of genetic engineering techniques of the
earthworms, we attempted to develop a transformation method of the earthworm
firstly. As a result, we succeeded to construct E. fetida transformation method
using microinjection and electroporation methods [3]. Also, we have revealed an
optimal medium, electroporation conditions, gene induction time for earthworm
gene injection. Furthermore, we could improve the survival rate from 15% to 88%,
and also the transformation efficiency from 11% to 16%, using medium
modification and so on. These results contribute to develop the fundamental
genetic engineering technology of the earthworm.",,,

body regeneration.","A planarian can regenerate itself even when more than 90 percent of its body is gone. From this
planarian tremendous regenerative ability, I hypothesized that planaria can produce one individual
from a single cell. If this hypothesis be proved, I think that it will lead to elucidation of the regeneration
mechanism. This can be expected to be applied to technology to reproduce the lost limbs. Cells
generally do not proliferate unless adhered. Therefore, I used various proteins to attach planarian cells.","I succeeded in dissociating planarian into a single cell. After that, adhesion assay was performed.
Crystal violet staining showed that Vitronectin tended to adhere easily. In parallel, I also attempted to
make planarian cancer. Since cancer cells are more proliferative than somatic cells, it is considered
that searching for culture conditions is easier than using somatic cells. There are several reports that
makes cancer in planaria 1 . Therefore, I thought that if I do it under the same conditions I will get
cancerized planaria. As a result, cancerized planaria has not appeared yet. So investigating conditions

micro-wells made by silicone elastomer.","Proteins secreted from the neighboring cells affect greatly in human body formation, so we are
investigating the secretion effects on cell differentiation using human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells
[1] . In stationary culture on a conventional culture dish, since the culture solution stays, the

Therefore, we investigated the secretion effect by using a microperfusion device made of a silicone
elastomer, polyimethylpolysiloxane (PDMS) and by perfusingthe culture solution to one direction [1, 2] .
To culture human iPS cells in serum-free medium on a microperfusion device made by PDMS, the
PDMS surface must be coated with a cell adhesion protein, but it is difficult to uniformly loading the
cells thereafter.
In this study, we examined one step (simultaneous) loading of cell adhesion protein and human iPS
cells on PDMS microwell.","In control condition (on polystyrene), although the cells adhered on iMatrix or vitronectin
pre-coated 96-well plate, the cells adhere on the plate under one-step loading with iMatrix, which is
the same as reported [3]. On the other hand, on PDMS, the cells adhered on both iMatrix and

that PDMS surface modification using 10 second treatment of oxygen plasma is not sufficient for the

peptidase from gram-negative bacteria.","Gram-negative bacteria Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana WO24, which was isolated from waste water in tofu production, has dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) that releases a dipeptide from the free N-terminal of the peptide chain. P. mexicana WO24 has many DPPs, most especially dipeptidyl aminopeptidase Bll (PmDAP BII) is belonged to the peptidase family S46 of clan PA which are bacterial distinctive peptidase. Bacteria possessed S46 peptidase are widely distributed in pathogenic non-fermenting gramnegative bacteria (NF-GNB) such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (multidrug-resistant opportunistic). Porphyromonas gingivalis (chronic periodontitis). Porphyromonas endodontalis (apical periodontitis) and Shewanella putrefaciens (food poisoning) and important enzymes for growth of them[1]. P. gingivalis has two S46 peptidases, dipeptidyl peptidase 7 (PgDPP7) and dipeptidyl peptidase 11 (PgDPP11), which are involved in nutrient utilization. Therefore, elucidation of the substrate recognition mechanisms of these enzymes leads to be development of the novel mechanism antibiotics for pathogenic NF-GNB.
We have determined crystal structures of PmDAPBll and PgDPP11[2]. Substrate specificity of S46 peptidases could be determined according to the kind of amino acid corresponding to the 675th residue of PmDAPBII. Gly675 (PmDAP BII), which is conventional substrate recognition residue, is conserved between PmDAPBII and PgDPP7 from periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis. However, substrate specificity of these enzymes is different. Therefore, it is possible that the other residue(s) involves in substrate recognition. Aim of this study is to discover new residue(s) as substrate recognition, we estimated Ser682, Ser682 and Met693 as substrate recognition residues in PmDAP Bll based on structure and alignment analysis. we analyzed these estimated residues mutants of PmDAPBll to elucidate the substrate recognition mechanisms in S46 peptidase.","Ser682 was determined as one of substrate recognition residues

I measured upper limb myoelectric and the seat pressure. The seat pressure was measured with a
body pressure distribution device. In the analysis I used the center point of the seat pressure which
is center of gravity. As a measurement result, hard driving was high iEMG compared with normal
driving. Both-handed driving was high iEMG in all the muscles compared with one-hand driving
in hard driving. But This result is different from the result of high iEMG in all the muscles in one-

Pellet (USP) reactor was installed for treatment of nitrate from DHS effluent. This
research focused on the stability of DHS system when applied for variable
characteristics of wastewater by flow rate fluctuation technique and performance of this
system. The operational system was intermittent. The high flow rate was set at 5 am to
12pm and 5 pm to 12 am with 1.02 L/min. Then the other was low flow rate (0.26
L/min). The organic loading rate (OLR) at high flow rate (fluctuated condition) was 0.85

6,Potential of nitirification in novel rotational sponge reactor.,"Nitrogen is removed through oxidization of ammonia to nitrate through nitrification process and
reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas through denitrification process (Kim et al. 2013). Because of the low
growth rate and higher oxygen demand, nitrification is generally a rate limiting and economically
expensive step in conventional wastewater treatment systems. Therefore developing new wastewater
treatment systems beyond conventional systems have become recent trend. On this verge novel Rotational
sponge (RS) reactor was developed and its application for the nitrification process was studied. Concept
of RS reactor is similar to the water wheel that is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle. RS reactor uses
an attached growth type treatment processes employing polyethylene sponges as support media for the
growth of bacteria. Buckets arranged on the outside rim lift the influent with the rotation and allow
wastewater to flow through packed sponges in the middle. Objective of this study is to determine physical
oxygen transfer rate (P-OTR) from atmosphere, as O 2 is a critical factor for nitrification and to analyze
the performance of nitrification of the RS reactor. In this study RS reactor with a diameter of 2 m and
width of 0.25 m and total volume (tank + sponge) of 200 L was used for the experiment. Firstly, physical
oxygen transfer rate and Oxygen transfer coefficient (K L a) were calculated for the rotational speeds of 5,
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 rounds per hour (rph) at immersion level of 15%. Finally, Reactor was
operated for 53 days to evaluate nitrification performance. Reactor was fed with inorganic synthetic
wastewater with NH 4 + -N concentration of 35 mgL -1 at HRT 16 h at 30 0 C. pH of influent was maintained
at the range of 8-9. Results revealed that P-OTR and K L a increased with rotational speed and RS reactor
obtained maximum of P-OTR and K L a 682 mgL -1 d -1 and 108 d -1 at 40 rph. Comparison with conventional
RBCs suggested that RS reactor achieved K L a of over 100 d -1 at one eighth of conventional RBCs. So that
RS reactor showed better ability to transfer oxygen than conventional RBCs. After first week of operation
RS reactor achieved effluent concentration of 1 (±0.25) mgL -1 , 33.1(±1.0) mgL -1 and 0.3 (±0.26) mgL -1 of

Models of PV modules.","In order to produce electric power with highest conversion efficiency from PV modules. it is necessary
to operate the PV modules at the maximum power point(MPP). However, MPP is not always consistent,

maximum power point tracking(MPPT) system. Common MPPT algorisms are the perturb and observe
method and the I-V characteristics scanning type of MPPT; however, it requires some time to track the
MPP, which causes power loss. In addition, further increase of response time is limited. Therefore, we
propose a new MPPT method to solve these problems. Our new method is capable of high-speed
response and does not need the I-V characteristics. In this research, we have confirmed that the method
works at approximately 260-ms intervals, and the relative errors are within 5%.
Details of the method:
You can estimate the parameters (Table 1.) using least squares fitting of the I-V characteristics
(experimental) with eq.(1) based on a equaivalent circuit of PV modules (theoretical). Then, the
parameters are corrected in terms of the irradience and temperature using eq.(2) and eq.(3) respectively.
In this way, the I-V characteristics varying with solar irradiance and temperature can be estimated
by using the reference I-V obtained experimentally. On the P-V characteristics, the gradient at the MPP

structure was the botryococcene analogue.
Compound 1 is an unsaturated hydrocarbon with vinylidene groups, vinyl group, and vinylene
group. It was estimated that Compound 1 could be polymerized at C26=C27 bond catalyzed by
palladium complex. However, the amount of hydrocarbon 1 was scarce at lab scale. Two

7,"Adsorbed formation of ZnPc on 4H-SiC(0001)-(1×1) reconstructed surface
with annealing temperature","Metal phthalocyanine (MePc) is very useful material for thermal and chemical stability,
which improves efficiency of applications in organic electronics. Especially this material is
potentially applicable for gas sensors and dye sensitized solar cells. It is important to
investigate about electronic structure and molecule behavior in local area, because knowledge
concerning with the control technique of molecule orientation and the adsorbed formation on
outermost surface contribute to the development of the electronic devices. Many researchers
have already reported about the adsorbed formations of MePc on semiconductor surface. At
the MePc films grown at room temperature, the molecules form stacked bilayer islands. The
structure of its bilayer is changed to a stable monolayer by an annealing procedure [1].
In this study, we have observed the electronic structure at the zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)
on 4H-SiC(0001)-(1×1) reconstructed surface by metastable atom induced electron
spectroscopy (MIES) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The reconstructed
surface on SiC was formed by surface thermal decomposition method. ZnPc molecules were
deposited to the surface up to 2000 s at room temperature. After deposition, the substrate was
annealed at 150
o C for 15 h to spread the molecules forming the islands on the substrate
surface. The surface structures were observed by low energy electron diffraction (LEED).
In the MIES spectrum at (1×1) reconstructed surface,
the peak induced by Si-3p state is appeared at 6.5 eV. At
ZnPc (200 s) deposited surface, we found the peak around
7.5 eV originated from ! molecular orbitals (MOs) which
distributed over the four outer benzene rings and the peak at
4 eV induced electron emissions from "" MOs of C–H and
C–C [2]. In the annealing temperature at 150
o C, the
intensity of the Pc ! peak slightly increased with annealing
compared to the adsorbed surface. It indicates that the
adsorbed formation of ZnPc molecules changed from
random structure to parallel to a surface by annealing. We
will discuss about the adsorbed formation of the ZnPc
molecular on 4H-SiC(0001)-(1×1) reconstructed surface
with deposition times and annealing temperatures.",,,

7,"Development of thiourea organocatalysts with the asymmetric twisted
structures of aromatic ureas","Organocatalyst based on remote asymmetric control has potential to
achieve flexible catalytic ability that responds to the external environment.
One of the flexible asymmetric backbones is cis conformational aromatic
urea with an asymmetric substituent on urea bond. Aromatic secondary
ureas, such as N,N’-diphenylurea exist in trans form both in the crystal and
in solution, whereas N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’-diphenylurea exists in cis form in
the crystal, and predominantly in cis form in various solvents (Fig. 1). Cis
conformational aromatic ureas with substituents at meta-position adopt
twisted arrangements with all-R or all-S of the axis chirality. In solution,
both enantiomers exist in the equilibrium between enantiomers, and the
handedness of the twisted structure can be biased to one side by
attachment of a hydrophilic chiral substituent on urea bond (Fig. 2).
In this study, we applied the chiral twisted structures of cis cnformational
aromatic ureas to organocatalysts by introducing thioureas that recognize
nucleophile and electrophile (Fig. 3), and applied them to the asymmetric
Aza-Henry reaction. The chiral hydrophilic substituents in the catalysts were
expected to recognize an alkali metal ion that can vary the enantiomeric
selectivity of the catalysts by effecting on the twisted way of the structure.","Bisthiourea organocatalysts 1 and 2 with the twisted aromatic ureas were applied to asymmetric Aza-Henry reaction, and showed
different enantiomeric selectivity of the Aza-Henry adducts depending on the external metal ion, which indicated that the chiral
hydrophilic substituents in the catalysts recognize an alkali metal ion that presumably effect on the twisted structure of the catalysts.
On the other hand, the reaction with catalysts 1 and 2 took long time at low temperature, and the reaction yield is low, so the
recognition of both electrophile (imine) and nucleophile (nitromethane) by two thioureas of catalysts, respectively, seemed not to
perfectly work, and presence of two thioureas might even prevent the reaction. To indicate the role of thiourea of catalyst in detail,

circular cylinder blades and the ring plate for improving the C p value which is its power performance

First, we explain the outline of analysis. Using the analysis software STAR-CCM+, it was
confirmed that a longitudinal vortex was generated behind the circular cylinder and the flat plate fixed

analysis is carried out in a situation where it moves vertically downward with respect to the flow at a
relative velocity of 1 m/s only to the cylinder. At that time, the gap is changed, and the velocity vector,
vorticity and pressure difference around the circular cylinder blade were compared and the tendency
of the gap and the optimum distance were investigated.

energy distribution of a power-law spectrum, and the highest energy of CRs reaches to 10 20
eV [1] . Shock phenomena occurring in collisionless plasma such as supernova remnants are
believed the energy source of CRs. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) has explained the non-
thermal energy distribution of CRs as a statistical acceleration process through the shock
transition layer [2] . However, the generation process of non-thermal particles in the non-
relativistic region for driving DSA due to non-linear interactions between the fast plasma flow

9,Tensile behavior of Bi added low Ag lead-free solder,"The RoHS directive restricts the use of lead solder for electronic appliances due to
environmental problems and human health hazards. In response to the restrictions, lead-
free solders such as SAC305 (Sn-3.0mass%Ag-0.5mass%Cu) have been developed as
replacement for lead solders. Sn-0.7mass%Cu based solder and low Ag (0.1-1.0mass%)
lead-free solder are two of the more promising alternatives owing to their low cost. Both
Sn-0.7mass%Cu and low Ag lead-free solder has been reported to exhibit somewhat
inferior tensile strength and high melting temperature compared to SAC305. Additional
adjustments are being made to get new Sn-0.7mass%Cu to exhibit high mechanical and
thermal properties. Recent studies show that the use of Bi addition to Sn-0.7mass%Cu is
an effective approach for improvement of melting temperature and mechanical properties.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of Bi addition to Sn-0.7mass%Cu and
SAC107 (Sn-1.0mass%Ag-0.7mass%Cu) on their tensile properties. Sn-0.7mass%Cu,
SAC107 and Bi (1 and 2 mass%) added to their alloys were used in this study. Tensile
tests were carried out at 298, 353, and 393 K under 1.0 ×10 -3 s -1 strain rate. After tensile
tests, microstructures of their specimens were observed by OM and SEM. The addition
of Bi to Sn-0.7mass%Cu and SAC107 improved tensile strength and had no influence on
elongation. It was found that dendrite structure exists in both Sn-0.7mass%Cu and
SAC107 alloys with/without Bi addition. This is because Bi is dissolved in the primary
solid-solution Sn. As the test temperature increased, the tensile strength of solder
alloys decreased due to the recovery and recrystallization of the microstructure. The
addition of Bi has greater effect on their tensile strength at high temperature (0.8Tm).",,,

9,"Estimation of ultimate lateral resistance of pile groups in clayey soils owing
to horizontal ground movement","In earthquake engineering, pile foundation has been designed against the lateral load
resulting from the horizontal ground movements by earthquake which may lead to structure
distress or failure. Therefore, estimation of ultimate lateral resistance of pile group is an important
task in the design of pile foundation. The advantage of using the finite element method (FEM) is
to simulate the pile-soil-pile system with the complex pile arrangement and to apply to non-
uniform grounds under two and three-dimensional conditions. FEM has been applied to calculate
the ultimate lateral resistance of pile groups subject to lateral ground movement such as Chen and
Poulos (1994) and Sloan (2013). It predicted exactly the ultimate lateral stress in cohesive soil as
well as cohesion-less soil.
This study estimated the ultimate lateral resistance of pile groups against horizontal ground
movement by using two-dimensional rigid plastic finite element method (RPFEM). The effect of
pile spacing on the ultimate lateral resistance was investigated through the case study with the
change in pile spacing. Regardless of pile arrangement, the obtained results indicate that the
ultimate lateral resistance of pile groups increased with increasing pile spacing. This trend was
found to be owing to the change in the failure mode of ground peripheral of piles. Since the each
pile in the group affects other pile, it leads the ultimate lateral resistance significantly depends on
pile position such as the front or back piles. The load apportionment ratio of each pile is therefore
different remarkably among piles in groups.
On the other hand, most previous studies did not take into account the effect of ground movement
direction on ultimate lateral resistance. This study discussed the direction effect of ground
movement on ultimate lateral resistance of pile groups. The direction effect of ground movement
was observed by the change in both the total of ultimate lateral resistance and the failure mode of
ground around piles. Since the results of RPFEM were found to be almost similar to Sloan et al.
(2013), it was finally concluded that the use of two-dimensional rigid plastic finite element
analysis provided a good estimation for the ultimate lateral resistance of pile groups against
horizontal ground movement due to the earthquake.",,,

nanosecond pulsed electric field facilities the increase in its electric field strength. As shown in Fig.1, the conduction
structure of CB forms linear assemblies inside the matrix, which could be developed to much thicker linear structures
over five times by the application control of the nanosecond pulsed electric fields. The novelty of this study lies in
the utilizing of nanosecond pulsed field with a high electric strength that overcomes the electrical breakdown during

sintering (TS-PECS). However, some defects appeared as black dots inside transparent bodies. These black
dots may reduce the transparency and cause some negative optical or thermal influences. In this study, these
black dots were observed and investigated to be reduced.
The cross section of black dots within transparent Al 2 O 3 was obtained by polishing and observed
under an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope. It was figured out that black dots inside
transparent bodies derived from hard agglomerates in the starting powder, which were not able to be broken
during sintering process. The amount of black dots was reduced by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as

Scale Developed on Metallic Materials","The hardball collision test is a method of dynamic spallation testing for oxide scale on
the metallic materials [1] . Compared with other spallation test methods, the present test method is
characterized by its simple structure and applicability for high temperature testing. One of the
problems in this method is difficulty in correct determination of spallation area of the oxide scale.
When the scale is detached but not removed, the spallation is not visible from the outside. In this
report, the spallation area of the scale after the hardball collision test was measured by using
fluorescent paint penetrating under the oxide scale. The hardball collision test was conducted as
follows: a hard steel ball with φ2.5 mm in diameter was shot perpendicular to the steel plate at
room temperature in approximately 60 m/s. The steel plate sample was made of mild steel (0.5
mass%C) oxidized at 800 °C for 5 min in air to form the oxide scale in 20 μm in thickness. The
sample after the spallation test was dipped into fluorescent paint (N-3D, TASETO Co.). The
sample was dried at 100 °C for 2 h in air. Fig.1 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) the
appearance of scale spallation after the collision test. Spallation area of the scale is very narrow.
Fig. 2 shows optical image of spallation area of the same sample of Fig.1 after dipping in a
fluorescent paint. The fluorescent paint entered the detaching area of the scale, showing the

progress of Nagaoka-Salesio collaborative work “An arrangement of electric vehicle charging facility at large city in south-eastern Asia”. The other is a research of multi- objective optimization problem. This year we pick up Genetic Algorithm as the method to solve it. We will explain the frame work of the research. The collaborative research is as follow;
There have been several studies for the estimation of trip distributions in the area using observed link-flow. The accuracy of the estimation much depends upon the location and the number of the traffic counting in the network. This study develops and applies mathematical models that locate traffic counting point to observe the maximum volume of vehicle flow. In this presentation, two models are proposed, which enable us to extract the effective links for the estimation of trip distributions. One of them is the optimization model to maximize a standard traffic flow and the other is total traveler kilometer. They are optimization problems that maximize the total captured flow and total traveler kilometer by locating points on the link.
Geographic Information Systems and Mathematical Programing are integrated in a spatial decision support system that researcher can use to develop data, enter assumptions and parameters, evaluate tradeoff and analyze sensibility for the parameters, and map results. In numerical simulation, several routes between the origin and destination are assumed. There models applied to the trunk road network of metropolitan city in Asia.
The second is multi-objective optimization problem. There are many methods to solve optimization problems. Genetic Algorithm(GA) is different from other methods in mathematical programming. All method except GA has only one solution in optimizing Computation. Solutions calculated by GA have diverseness in solution set. This feature is useful to calculate solutions in multi-objective optimization problems.
In this research, we pick up a multi-objective bin packing problem. One objective function is to minimize number of bins used and the other is deviation of center of gravity which made by load pattern of items.
Items are different in size and weight. The changing packing order or methods makes number of bins increase and center of gravity move large. If number of bins used is increasing, it makes times of driving operations increase in truckload transportation. At last it connects to rising transportation cost. Also if center of gravity deviates from right position, fuel consumption gets worse. It is trade-off relationship in two objective functions. In the multi- objective optimization problems, it selects appropriate from some solutions.
In this research, we will show an effectiveness of GA to solve multi-objective optimization problem in numerical simulation. In order to compare the performance, we use integer programming to solve the problem and evaluate the Calculation precision and Calculation time.",,,

11,Pavement deformation detection based sensor fusion.,"The state of the road surface changes day by day due to traffic, weather, temperature change, causing road deformation. Road deformity has cracks, pot holes, ruts, etc. These not only impair comfort during driving but also can cause accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly check and repair the road. One of the factors of cracks, pot holes, and rut is the cavity generated under the pavement. Currently, the main cavity position measurement method is geophysical exploration using a ground underground cavity explorer utilizing ground penetrating radar, but there is a problem with equipment cost and investigation effort, and it is not widely spread."," In this research, in order to investigate the possibility of estimating the cavity position from the heat distribution information and the height information of the road surface, an infrared camera and a laser scanner were attached to the vehicle and road damage due to liquefaction was measured.

13,Basic research of the acquisition of biological information towards the construction of agricultural support system.,"In recent years, agricultural support systems that utilize information and communication technology (ICT) have been studied.
Growth environmental monitoring and data accumulation become easier by applying the data of weather, soil and image which is gathered from Industrial ICT equipment.
However, it is difficult for new farmers to utilize those of data because the grasp of the growth condition depends on the decision of skilled farmers.
In order to construct an advanced cultivation management system, it is necessary to develop a sensing technique for acquiring a growth condition that is quantified.
Therefore, we focused on the leaf color, which is one of the biological information, we performed the basic research about leaf color and growth in order to develop a new sensor in lower cost.

14,Microbial community structure in lake shinji stratification.,"Shinji Lake is located in the eastern part of Shimane prefecture, it is the third largest brackish water lake in Japan. It has been occurred problems such as water pollution and eutrophication. For example, many Aoko occurred in Lake Shinji area from 2010 to 2012. Moreover, in the upper layer is oxygen supply by the atmosphere and photosynthesis, but in the low oxygen of bottom layer is occurred by consumption accompanying decomposition of organic matter. Thus, In this study, microorganisms in surface and bottom brackish water in Shinji Lake were investigated by using 16s rRNA targeted gene analysis.
As a result, As a result, Proteobacteria were most dominant in surface of Shinji Lake, and Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique belonging to SAR 11 clade, which is a group of uncultivated microorganisms living in the ocean, was detected more frequently in August and may be involved in the carbon cycle and nitrogen circulation (Fig.1).􏴘􏴀On the surface of Shinji Lake many microorganisms closely related to Terrabacter carboxydivorans, reported as Actinomycetes oxidizing carbon monoxide were detected over the whole period.

14,MICROBIAL COMMUNITY ANALYSIS IN BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN REMOVAL (DHS-USB) REACTOR TREATING RECIRCULATING FRESHWATER AQUARIUM,"A biological nitrogen system, Down-flow Hanging Sponge (DHS) and Up-flow Sludge Blanket (USB) system was developed to eliminate water exchange necessity in aquaria. DHS-USB system has successfully maintained ammonium (NH3), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3- ) concentrations within target value for freshwater breeding over its 200 days of operation but water exchange was still performed to dilute yellow substance that accumulated over time.1) Currently, ozone (O3) was introduced to degrade yellow substances in the water, assisting DHS-USB system towards a maintenance-free system for freshwater aquaria. However, combination of ozone with biological nitrogen removal system often hampered the performance of the biological nitrogen removal units.2) Therefore, an analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence was performed to investigate the microbial community structure in the DHS-USB reactors during ozone exposure period and without ozone exposure period. Sponge and sludge samples were collected respectively on day 10, 86, 370 and 550. The collected samples were washed with phosphate buffer before DNA extraction was performed. PCR amplification was performed using universal primer 515F and 806R with the following conditions: 1 cycle of 3 min initial complete denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 25 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 60 s of 50 °C, 90 s of 72 °C and 10 min final extension at 72 °C.3) PCR products were sequenced using MiSeq System (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and the sequences were analyzed using Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME v.1.9.1). In this study, a significant increase in Crenarcheota was observed in DHS reactor at phase 2 compared to phase 1 and 3 during the absence of O3. Ca. Nitrososphaera and Nitrosopumilus belonging to Crenarcheota phyla are crucial nitrifying archaea in freshwater. On the other hand, Proteobacteria phyla which commonly consist of most denitrifying bacteria seemed to decrease in the USB reactor. Despite that, NO3- concentration was still maintained below 10 mg-N L-1. Reduction in DHS reactor performance was not observed although competition for NO2- were reported often impacted the system performance. In addition, fish survived without performing water exchange for 425 days. Application of O3 with DHS-USB system seemed capable of eliminating water exchange necessity due to color build up in previous study.",,,

1,"Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.
 As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.
 Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty.

Many developing countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their nutritional needs. Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger.
 Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There are 821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of Africa, as well as in South America.
 The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2044, making sure all people–especially children–have sufficient and nutritious food all year. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity.",,,,
