for plant diseases caused by plant parasitic nematodes. And the growth conditions of free-living nematodes in soil conditioners were determined. As a result, it was confirmed that the number of nematodes grew from about 200 individual (ind.)/10g-Dry Matter (D.M.) to more than 1.5×105 ind./10g-D.M. when using sewage sludge was mixed. Thus, it is considered that the bacteria in sewage sludge including Bacillus sp. became good feeds for nematodes and proliferated."
2,1,Comparative analysis of soil microbial communities in cherry tomato cultivation fields supplemented with green tuff ,"A tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the popular edible vegetable in Japan. The amount of domestic production and import volume of fresh tomato in 2018 were 657,100 tons and 9,238 tons, respectively. In this study, we focused on a cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum ver. cerasiforme), which is occupied 10% of domestic tomato production. Recently, demand of a cherry tomato has increased in the world owing to presence of several benetifical functional components (e.g. lutein and lycopene) and high preservability. For stable cultivation of a cherry tomatoes, supplementation of minerals and good nutrient cycling in soil are important. The essential minerals for tomato cultivation are known as calcium and magnesium, which are necessary for the growth and chlorophyll production, respectively. The lack of each mineral causes rot of the tomato and yellowish leaves. Although supplementation of minerals are often performed by additional chemical fertilizer or direct spray of minerals to fruits and leaves, these management requires sensitive monitoring of tomato growth and high cost. In addition to mineral supplementation, microorganisms play an important role for nutrient cycling in the soil. Besides, some studies have been reported that the lower biodiversity in the soil affects to plant diseases due to decrease of presence of antagonistic organisms against pathogens. Therefore, to maintain the “healthy” condition of soil biodiversity, proportion of organic farming has increased. However, it is not easy to switch into organic farming immediately because the manual of organic farming for increase of biodiversity is not well established. Therefore, to increase soil biodiversity, we focused on characteristics of green tuff, which has several kinds of minerals, porous structures, and good elution capacity of calcium and magnesium. In previous our study, we confirmed the increase of biodiversity in green-onion cultivation field applying green tuff with organic fertilizers. However, the single influence of green tuff supplementation for plant cultivation is still unknown.
Our purpose of this study is evaluation of effects of green tuff supplementation into soil microbiome
  and chemical characteristics. To investigate the effect of green tuff supplementation, we prepared three types of 22
test areas with 1) no addition of green tuff, 2) 40kg/1000 m , and 3) 200kg/1000 m . To follow the changes of soil chemical and microbial characteristics, we sampled 11 times for 244 days cherry tomato cultivation (days 1, 8, 15, 29, 64, 93, 126, 165, 188, 217, and 244). Microbial community analysis was performed based on 16S rRNA gene sequence using High throughput DNA sequencer MiSeq. In doing so, we could find the difference of microbial co-occurrence network and unique microbial community changes among test areas."
2,12,Analysis of free-living nematodes in Chinese yam farm with the soil improvement material ,"Chinese yam is vulnerable to dryness, grows under fertile soil and requires specific climatic conditions. Gunma Prefecture has one of the largest productions in Japan. However, plant parasitic nematodes cause damages to Chinese yam and reduce crop production.
We have developed the soil improvement material (including Bacillus subtilis 1x107 (per 1 g dry weight) and free-living nematodes 1x104 (per 10 g wet weight)) utilizing biomass resources such as cedar bark, dried sludge and dehydrated soil. At the beginning of June 2018, the improvement material was introduced once in the test field of Chinese yam (3 kg / m2), and during the period until harvesting in November of the same year. The soil samples were collected once a week from the predetermined region (1st and 2nd wards). In this study, occurrence and genetic variation of free-living nematodes associated with the soil improvement material were investigated. The number of nematodes was maintained 100-1500 / 10 g during the half-year cultivation period in the test field. The nucleic acid sequences of rDNA ITS1 region were compared, and species of nematodes were identified as Cephalobidae sp., a mycophagous nematode and Phelenchoides sp. Furthermore, predatory nematodes, Paractinolaimus sp. and Rhyssocolpus which are considered to be effective in controlling continuous cropping disorders, were observed.
2
The yield of Chinese yam was 138 kg at a cultivation area of 60 m , and the shipping amount was 95 %, and it
was evaluated as being the same as when chemical pesticides were used. It was suggested that the soil amendment material has the effect of inhibiting cropping damage equivalent to chemical pesticides."
2,15,Identification of Arabidopsis SMOM8 gene involved in transgene expression ,"Transgenic plants with various useful traits have potentials to solve global issues such as food shortages and environmental problems. However, expression of the foreign genes, is often suppressed by host plant activities. This phenomenon is called Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS). It is known that DNA methylation, one of the chemical modifications on DNA molecule, causes TGS in eukaryotes, but how DNA methylation influence the gene expression is little understood. In a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, the mom1 mutation releases TGS in hypermethylated foreign genes without changes of the DNA methylation [1]. This suggests that the MOM1 protein acts downstream or independently of DNA methylation in TGS by unknown mechanism. To identify the novel factors which act in TGS mediated by MOM1, we performed a forward genetic screening for suppressor of mom1 mutation, named suppressor of mom1 (smom). In this study, we focus on one of the suppressor mutants, smom8. Phenotypic analyses of the mutant revealed that the SMOM8 gene is not involved only in transgene expression but also in expression of endogenous gene regulated by the MOM1 protein. Genetic analyses showed that the smom8 mutation is recessive and associated with a single locus. Linkage analysis indicated that SMOM8 gene is located on the chromosome 4."
2,15,Application of epigenome editing technology using CRISPR/Cas9 to plants ,"In eukaryotes, a methyl group is often added to cytosine base of DNA resulting in change of gene expression, which is called DNA methylation. It is known that pattern of DNA methylation can be maintained precisely during DNA replication. In plants, patterns of DNA methylation are often maintained even throughout meiosis, meaning that some of the changes can be inherited into the next generation. This allow changes of DNA methylation pattern to be applied into the plant breeding.
Recently, techniques for artificially manipulating pattern of DNA methylation, termed epigenome editing, in plant cells have been reported [1][2]. In the reports, epigenome editing techniques based on a CRISPR/Cas9-SunTag targeting system in a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, have been developed. They used tobacco DRM methylase and human TET1 demethylase as methylation effectors. It is still unclear whether their epigenome editing system can be applied generally, since the system is demonstrated to act on only a few specific genes loci such as the FWA locus. In order to develop novel epigenome editing system, we used another CRISPR/Cas9 system (SaCas9) isolated from Staphylococcus aureus instead of CRISPR-Cas9 system (SpCas9) from Streptococcus pyogenes which is commonly used. Our system would be expected to be applied to more generall purposes by combined with the SpCas9 system. In this study, we have created two kinds of the DNA constructs expressing dead SaCas9 proteins (dSaCas9s) which lack the double-strand break activity by introducing mutations, and are fused to Arabidopsis thaliana DRM2 methylase and DML3 demethylase, respectively. Using CRISPR/dSaCas9-DRM2 system, we tried to regulate DNA methylation and expression levels of GLABRA2 (GL2) and SUPERMAN (SUP) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we will present the results of the expression and DNA methylation analyses of GL2 and SUP loci in the epigenome editing plants."
2,1,Microbial community analysis of newly prepared sewage sludge compost for button mushroom cultivation ,"
In Japan, approximately 2.34 million tons of sewage sludge is produced annually from sewage treatment plants. In recent advance of sewage sludge utilization, successful cultivation of strawberries and tomatoes using fertilizer derived from sewage sludge. Our research group has succeeded on button mushroom and oyster mushrooms cultivation using sewage sludge and underutilized biomass. For button mushroom cultivation, using sewage sludge compost and cattle manure compost with optimized peat moss as medium cover material, we could increase yields as 1.5–1.7 times higher than conventional cultivation method (100% cattle manure compost utilization). However, proportion of sewage sludge compost in mushroom media become lower due to higher Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio (17–20) requirement of button mushroom medium because C/N ratio of commercial sewage sludge compost is 6–8. In addition, the sewage sludge compost contains small amount of lignin (20% of cattle manure compost), which is necessary to cultivate button mushrooms. Besides, it is known that button mushroom hyphae preys on thermophilic bacteria belonging to orders Actinomycetales and Bacillales. In previous our study, results of button mushroom cultivation using sewage sludge compost with cattle manure compost indicated that the proportion of orders Bacillales bacteria increased along with the yield of mushrooms. Therefore, the difference of the microbial community structures in the mushroom media might be affected the yields of mushroom.
In this study, we attempted to produce new sewage sludge compost with a high C/N ratio and investigated the microbial community structures in mushroom media with different compost materials. Three types of compost were prepared as test areas 1: sewage sludge (mixing rate: 44.1%), soil improvement materials, and field soil (55.9%), test area 2: sewage sludge (11.1%), soil improvement materials (25.1%), field soil (47.0%), bamboo chips (8.3%), dried “Shochu” distillery waste (2.8%), and rice bran (5.6%), and test area 3: sewage sludge (40.0%), bamboo chips (30.0%), dried “Shochu” distillery waste (10.0%), and rice bran (20.0%).To evaluate the changes of microbial community structures in different composts, we performed MiSeq-based 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and cultivation of general bacteria using nutrient broth (NB) and diluted NB media. As a result of fermentation of different compost materials, while order Actinomycetales predominated in test areas 1 and 2 (abundance rates, 1: 16.5% and 2: 20.2%), order Bacillales (21.7%) was predominant in test area 3. These results suggested that the difference of mixing rates of compost materials greatly influenced into the microbial community structures."
2,6,NEW CONCEPT OF AQUACULTURE SYSTEM FED WITH TREATED SEWAGE AS NUTRIENTS SOURCES ,"Based on previous research on combination system of down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor and aquaponics cultivation system, nutrients that were not contained in the fish feed act as the limiting factors to the plants overall growth. The byproduct from ammonia nitrification in the DHS reactor, nitrate was readily available in the system. But, the scarcity of other important nutrient such as phosphate and iron, plant`s important internal functions such as nitrate uptake was inhibited, causing it to accumulate and unused. The periodical supplement of commercial fertilizer to the system was able to prevent excessive nitrate accumulation and promote plant`s growth recovery. In the long run, whether the practice of adding fertilizer to the system is sustainable is questionable. Therefore, sewage treated by DHS reactor contains phosphorous and nitrogen while the sponges are also a good growing place for fly`s larvae. Its nutrients rich properties is suitable to help overcome macro and micro nutrients problems in the aquaculture, at the same time, larvae can be an addition feed for the fish. Therefore, by substituting the fertilizer with the treated sewage, a semi-organic sustainable aquaculture system can be achieved."
2,14,EVALUATION OF KEY FACTOR FOR GROWTH OF SEAWEED IN AN AQUAPONICS-BASED AQUACULTURE SYSTEM FOR SEA WATER ,"Sea water aquaponics-based closed aquaculture system combined with seaweed cultivation has been conducted. Acanthogobius flavimanus, Palaemon pacificus, Crassostrea gigas, Caulerpa lentillifera were selected as fishery products and sea weed. Water in the aquarium was circulated by submerged pump via seaweed cultivation and down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor. Mechanical aeration was not conducted in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen concentration in the aquarium was kept more than 6 mg/L by water circulation via the DHS reactor and photosynthesis by C. lentillifera. In the aquaculture system, average concentration of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate were 0.34 ± 0.38 mgN/L, 0.04 ± 0.03 mgN/L and 3.2 ± 1.4 mgN/L, respectively. During experimental period, growth of C. lentillifera was stopped after three month cultivation. After replacement of 10% aquarium water with fresh sea water, C. lentillifera started to grow again. These results indicated that micronutrient in sea water become key factor for growth of C. lentillifera in the aquaculture system."
2,9,Development of remote ventilation and agro-environmental monitoring system for greenhouse,"
【Introduction】In general, the greenhouses are used for raising seedlings and cultivation of crops. Temperature and humidity control in the greenhouse is very important to produce high-quality seedlings and crops. Recently, sudden heavy rains and typhoons occur frequently in Japan. It is impossible for producers to manually ventilate in response to sudden changes in the temperature and humidity due to abnormal weather. Therefore, in this study, we are developing a remote ventilation and agro-environmental monitoring system for the greenhouse using smart devices.
【Development】 Figure 1 show the concept of remote ventilation and agro-environmental monitoring system. A webserver was constructed using RaspberryPi in the operation box. A webserver was accessed from a smart device via HTTP communication. The electric motors were operated using Arduino and the operation of the electric motor was controlled by the producer using a web application. Finally, we developed a remote ventilation system.
【Results】The manual ventilation of greenhouses has taken between 15 and 20 minutes per building. In contrast, the ventilation using the developed system was one and a half minutes per building. Also, it was found that multiple greenhouses can be ventilated at the same time and can be controlled from remote locations.
【Conclusion】It was found that ventilation work can be completed in a very short time by using this developed system compared with manual ventilation."
3,4,Effects of Tone Color Difference on Relaxation Effects,"People are exposed to various stresses in living. This is, it can be a factor that lowers the quality of our lives. We need effective relaxation methods in order to reduce our daily stress. Listening to the music is one of effective relaxation methods. It has been reported that music has various effects such as giving relaxation, giving further motivation, and giving more concentration [1]. It is a well-known fact that musical instruments are used to produce sound as material for the music. Even if you play the same song with different instruments, the overall impression of the song will change dramatically. Therefore, in this research, we investigate and analyze the relaxation effect by the difference of timbre (frequency component) for the purpose of discovering more effective relaxation.
The relaxation effect is evaluated by brain activity and autonomic nerve activity. The same timbre is used except for the main melody, and the main melody is played at the same tempo and the same volume using the four timbres of piano, flute, organ, and violin.
signal amplitude[dB]
-50dB
As an example, Figure 1 shows the frequency components of the piano and organ. Both the organ and the piano are recorded from a keyboard tone. Both keys are the same as 880 Hz (A5), however, the organ includes more harmonics than that of the piano.
We are going to investigate whether the difference of these components affects or not."
3,9,"DIELECTROPHORETIC MANIPULATION AND SEPARATION OF CELLS BY
USING OCTPOLE ELECTORODES","Introduction
Cell manipulation technique is very required in the research of biomedicine, bioscience and other fields. The equipment currently used for this purpose such as micro-manipulator or optical tweezer is usually bulky and expensive because these are using mechanical system. Therefore, miniaturized and low-cost cell manipulation systems to utilize a dielectrophoresis(DEP) have been studied in recent years. DEP is the phenomenon that a force acts on a dielectric particle exposed to a spatially non-uniform electric field. The direction of the force becomes positive or negative by a relation of dielectric constants between the particle and surrounding medium. In the negative DEP(nDEP) the force acts toward weak electric field region. We succeed trapping a cell at minimum point of electric field and manipulating the cell by controlling a position of minimum electric field in an octpole electrodes. In this study, we investigated cells / particles separation by using a difference of dielectrophoretic force in the octpole electrodes. For the first step, using different size polystyrene beads instead of cells because magnitude of DEP force depend on a particle size. The moving time of particles were measured when the particle was manipulated in the octpole electrodes.
Experimental method and result
Polystyrene beads with diameter of 6[um] and 10[um] were used as object of manipulation. At first, the bead was trapped at the minimum point of electric field (A in Fig.1) made by octpole electrode and the position of the minimum point was changed to B. The required time moving from A to B was measured each size polystyrene beads. Table 1 shows experimental result. From the result, a difference of the DEP force with particle size was verified, but the difference is smaller than the value expected by the theory."
3,9,Design of photoluminescent hydroxyapatite nanoparticles interacting citric acid,"For the development of cell-labeling nanomaterials, the improvement of biocompatibility, luminescence intensity and water dispersibility is desired. We have clarified the importance of photofunction associated with the hydroxyapatite (HA)/organic hybrid structures. In this study, we aimed to synthesize the efficient luminescence ability including the luminescence internal efficiency based on the photofunctional interfaces between the citric acid (Cit) and Eu+-containing HA (Eu:HA) (2) in the hybrid nanoparticles (NPS), and investigate the Cit effect on the suppression of the HeLa (Human Cervical Carcinoma) cell line growth. In particular, the hybrid NPs between Eu:HA and Cit (Cit/Eu:HA) were synthesized, and the luminescent properties and water dispersibility with adding Cit were investigated. Moreover, the cytocompatibility and the cell-labeling properties were evaluated to investigate the effect of the Cit/Eu:HA NPs on the suppression of the HeLa cell growth by the Cit molecules (Fig. 1). As a result, the Cit/Eu:HA NPs were successfully synthesized, leading to the luminescence enhancement based on the novel inorganic/organic hybrid structures and improvement of water dispersibility by the charge repulsion among Cit molecules. Furthermore, the cytostatic suppression and the cell-labeling were achieved for the HeLa cells."
3,6,Transparent Thin Film Hydroxyapatite by Addition of Citric Acid on Glass Surface,"Therefor, in this study, it was investigated that transparent HA thin-film was prepared HA slurry by adding citric acid. The calcium nitrate 2000 (Ca(NO3)2:4H20) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate ((NH4)H2PO4) were dissolved in ion exchanged water. Citric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH of the HA slurries to 8.8, 8.6, 8.4, 8.2, and 8.0. Obtained HA sluury of DLS size and zeta potential were evaluated by zetasizer
8.0 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 9.0 measurements. It was indicated that HA slurry at
Fig. 1 DLS size and zeta potential at various pH8.2 was dispersed by sedimentation test.
pH of HA slurry Dispersed HA slurry was dropped on the glass by heating at 500°C for 10min."
3,9,"Release of Protein from the Silica-Cholesterol-bearing Hyaluronic Acid Hybrid
Hydrogel","A hydrogel scaffold that sustains releasing of protein in an active state is important for regenerative medicine. Cholesterol-bearing hyaluronic acid (CHA) composed from liner polysaccharide of hyaluronic acid (HA) and cholesteryl group forms hydrogel particles spontaneously by the hydrophobic interaction between cholesteryl groups in water. CHA particles can be used as a protein carrier because of their incorporation and release easily of proteins!. Previously, we prepared the CHA-silica hydrogel by the just mixing the CHA (HA MW 1.11 X 10%, degree of substitution of cholesteryl groups per 100 HA units is 35) and watersoluble organosilane (THEOS). The formation of siloxane bond by cross-linkage in the CHA-THEOS hydrogel was confirmed by 29Si MAS-NMR spectra. The FT-IR spectra of the CHA-THEOS hydrogel also showed presence of siloxane bond in the hydrogel. The CHA-THEOS hydrogel was stable for a week in PBS at 37°C. In this study, we prepared the protein incorporated CHA-THEOS hydrogel and measured activity of the protein released from the hydrogel. We used lysozyme as a model protein. As a result, lysozymes released from the CHA-THEOS hydrogel showed some activity. In contrast, there were no activity of lysozymes released from the HA-THEOS hydrogel and the THEOS hydrogel. These results indicated that the CHA particles prevented the denaturation of lysozyme during the formation of the hydrogel by sol-gel reaction of THEOS. By the hydrogelation using THEOS, hydrogels containing functional polymers such as PEG can be easily prepared. The CHA-THEOS hydrogel can be expected as a hydrogel scaffold for sustain release of proteins in active state."
3,4,"Investigation of Relationship Between Progress of Creative Activity
and Brain Activity by Simplified Music Composition","In our daily life, we enjoy creative activity such as music, movie, picture and novel. When we come up with a good idea and/or we get excited in creative activity, sometimes we can make high quality work or obtain good progress, which can be postulated that brain becomes active in these conditions. In this research, we investigate relationship between work progress, self-evaluation and brain activity in music composition as a creative activity. If we reveal these, there is a possibility that we can invent method of brain activation for creative activity. Brain activities during composition are determined from 10-channel wearable optical topography(WOT-100).
However, in this research, to secure plenty of subjects was difficult since the people who are not knowledgeable about music cannot compose the music generally. Therefore, we invented new simplified method of composition that is creatable even if a subject has never composed music and/or played instruments. In advance, we created three instrument's phrases in common key (A minor) and tempo (120bpm) which are 11 drum's phrases, 7 electric guitar's phrases for accompaniment and 11 electric guitar's phrases for melody. Songs will be created by choosing these phrases and combining freely. We quantitatively evaluate brain activity by the WOT-100 when the subjects execute the relaxation task and the composition task. Listening to natural ambient sound such as sound of wind, river, birds singing and so on and closing eyes were chosen for the relaxation task which is used as control [1]. After the relaxation task, the composition task is executed. We will ask the subjects refrain from moving their body, particularly head and neck as much as possible under experiment to decrease influence of body movement. We will also measure time that the subjects spent until finish to create song and use this as progress. Furthermore, in order to investigate how satisfy created songs, we will ask subjects subjective evaluations from 0 to 100 points using VAS (visual analog scale) after the experiment. Details of cerebral blood flow measurement and calculation are described in reference [2]
As a predict result, both of right- and left-prefrontal cortex is activated. However, how to change of cerebral blood flow indicate some characteristics or differences due to differences of progress or self-evaluation."
3,9,Exploring the target selectivity of PAD4 inhibitor with molecular dynamics simulation,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects 1% of the world's population, and it cause physical dysfunction by synovial arthritis and destructive joint lesion. Fundamental treatment of RA is still not found as of this moment, thus development of orally administrated drugs which can take easily and less physical burden is required. Protein Arginine Deiminase (PAD) is the enzyme which converts peptidyl-arginine into peptidyl-citrulline. This modification is termed citrullination or deamination. There are five PAD isozymes (PADI, PAD2, PAD3, PAD4 and PADO). PAD1 to PAD4 possess citrullination activity, whereas PAD6 doesn't because of number of mutations. Among the four PAD isozymes, previous studies show that PAD4 are overexpressed in RA and citrullinates a number of target proteins. One of the main connections between dysregulated PAD4 activity and RA is that RA patients produce autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins [1]. For these reasons, PAD4 is drawing attention as promising drug target in RA therapy. Since the isozymes share homologous sequences and possess a high degree of sequence identity (more than 50 %), inhibitors that can bind to PAD4 may also bind to other isozymes. Selectivity is one of the most important factors affecting side effects. To date, GSK 199 has been reported as potential PAD4 selective inhibitor[2]. The dissociation constant of GSK 199 and PAD4 is 16 + 4.9uM whereas the dissociation constant of GSK199 and PADI, PAD2, and PAD3 are 570 + 265uM, 1580 + 930M, and 925 + 220uM respectively. The complex structure of GSK199 and PAD4 (PDB ID: 4X8G) is reported, however, PAD1/GSK199 complex, PAD2/GSK199 complex, and PAD3/GSK199 complex are still not reported.
It is necessary for developing PAD4 selectivity inhibitor to elucidate the target selectivity of GSK199 based on structure information. This research plans to conduct modeling of PAD1/GSK199 complex, PAD2/GSK199 complex, and PAD4/GSK199 complex, molecular dynamics simulation for each complex structure, and proteininhibitor interaction analysis. Here we discuss target selectivity of GSK199."
3,9,Elucidation of target selectivity of selective MCL1 inhibitor using molecular dynamics simulation,"    The B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene family have a central role in regulating programmed cell death by regulating intracellular signaling with pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), one of the BCL2 gene family anti-apoptotic protein, is needed to sustain the growth of cancer cells such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma [1]. In addition, cancers caused by dysregulation of MCL1 are associated with poor survival rate and resistance to chemotherapy. For these reasons, MCL1 are attracting attention as drug discovery targets.
However, the high-affinity interactions with MCLI's endogenous ligands, along with sequence similarity to BCL2 and BCL-XL that both are anti-apoptotic protein (the sequence identity between MCL1 and BCL-2 and MCL1 and BCL-XL are 33% and 29% respectively) has made it challenging to design small molecules that inhibit MCL1. Recently, AMG-8621 was reported as a selective MCL1 inhibitor [2]. The inhibitory ability of AMG-8621 to MCL1 is 0.00005 umol/L, whereas the inhibitory ability to BCL-2 and BCL-XL is 2.5 umol/L and 1.9 umol/L respectively. To develop better MCL 1-selective inhibitors, it is necessary to elucidate the target selectivity of AMG-8621 based on structural information. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the target selectivity of the MCL1 selective inhibitor AMG-8621. First, we plan to design BCL-2/AMG-8621 complex and BCL-XL/AMG8621 complex because no structural information about these complexes is reported. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulation and interaction analysis are performed on MCL1/AMG-8621 complex (PDB ID: 6OQB), BCL-2/AMG-8621 complex and BCL-XL/AMG-8621 complex. In this poster presentation, we will discuss the target selectivity of AMG-8621 based on the results of protein-inhibitor complex modeling and interaction analysis."
3,9,The possibility of actin as “mechano-sensor”,"Actin form part of the cytoskeleton is most abundant protein in eukaryotic cell. Under physiological ionic conditions, monomeric actin polymerize to form filamentous actin (F-actin). Actin is involved in a large number of cellular functions such as muscle contraction, cell migration and cell division. For example, in cancer cell invasion, actin polymerization contributes to force generation for cell migration [1]. These cell functions are depending on interaction between F-actin and various actin-binding proteins (ABPs). ABPs change molecular structure of actin subunit within F-actin, which thought to be important for functions of ABPs 12).
In our body, cells under various external forces, which are involved in cell functions. For example, blood vessel cells sense the change of shear stress, and control blood presser by to expand or shrink blood vessel pores. Furthermore, cells forced by neighboring cell in body. If this force is disappeared, cells become to die. These phenomena are indicating that cells have mechanical sensors. Recently, it has been suggested that one of mechanical sensors is F-actin (3]. The external forces supplied to cells are speculated to change molecular structure of F-actin and affect localization of ABPs in cell. This re-arrangement of APBs in cells may lead to response of cells to the mechanical force.
However, the distribution of actin structures in cells has not been observed, and the relationships between actin structure, localizations of ABPs in cell and the external force to cell are unclear. In this study, we developed the FRET probed actin (FRET actin; Fig.1) which allow us to detect structural differences of actin in living cell. We first confirmed the competence as probe to detect conformational

4 on cell differentiation by using human induced pluripotent stem cells and perfusion culture chamber
cell density condition, cells located upstream area were differentiated but those cells located downstream area were not. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the differentiated cells secreted Noggin and secreted Noggin inhibits BMP-4 at downstream, resulting in the cells located downstream area were not differentiated. To test our hypothesis, we simulated substance concentration in the perfusion culture chamber. The substance concentration was simulated based on Navier-Stokes equations with reaction terms. The cells were differentiated when the cells were exposed by BMP-4 over threshold level, and then start to secrete Noggin. The condition of which the threshold of differentiation has variation by uniform random numbers leads to similar results as our previous experiment (fig 1). All cells were differentiated in the condition that thresholds were constant values. However, cells located upstream area were differentiated but those cells located downstream area were not, in the condition that the thresholds were random values. This result consistent with our hypothesis. As a future subject, we will also test other relation between accumulated BMP-4 and Noggin secretion."
3,9,Differences in adhesion on poly dimethyl cyclohexane and polystyrene using human iPS cells,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are expected to be used in regenerative medicine and drug discovery. Normally, human iPS cells adhere and culture on a cell culture substrate made of tissue-culture-treated polystyrene (TCPS). On the other hand, polystyrene dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) enables microfabrication of laboratory equipment such as microfluidic device due to its characteristics and ease of molding[1]. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that iPS cells are easier detached from PDMS surface than on TCPS[2]. These results suggest that cell adhesion is different between PDMS and TCPS. In this study, by comparing various adhesive properties between them, we examined the conditions for easy bonding.
First, iPS cells and laminin fragments were introduced simultaneously on PDMS and TCPS to examine whether cell adhesion[3]. As a result, cells were adhere on TCPS, but not on PDMS, suggesting that a difference in cell attachment time. Next, PDMS and TCPS were coated with laminin fragments or vitronectin for 1, 4, and 24hours respectively to examine the differences in cell adhesion. As a result, cell adhesion was observed after short period coating of laminin fragments on TCPS. However, in PDMS, cell adhesion time was shortened by using vitronectin as a coating agent. Finally, to improve hiPSC adhesion on PDMS surface vitronectin was pre-coated for 24 hours, and then laminin fragments and iPS cells were introduced simultaneously (double coat). As a result, the adhesion of cells in TCPS depends on the concentrations of laminin fragment and vitronectin. When TCPS was double coated, there was no interaction between laminin fragments and vitronectin. On the other hand, it was confirmed that the concentration of vitronectin has a significant effect on PDMS, and double coating may improve cell adhesion.
These results suggest that when PDMS is used, the cell adhesion is weaker than TCPS and the coating needs to be improved."
3,9,"Effects of thalidomide on the formation of neuron from
human induced pluripotent stem cells","Although thalidomide was once given to pregnant women as a gentle sedative, it has been shown to be highly teratogenic. Recently, interest in thalidomide has been renewed due to its therapeutic effects on intractable diseases. However, the teratogenicity of thalidomide is not yet fully understood. The effect of thalidomide on mesoderm (future muscle and bone) is well known. However, thalidomide also affects the nerves. For example, taking thalidomide has been shown to paralyze the terminal nerve.
In this study, we evaluated the effect of thalidomide on early neuronal differentiation by using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Neuronal differentiation was induced for 6 days. Thalidomide was simultaneously exposed with ectoderm differentiation. The immunostaining results showed that neuronal marker expressed in both the control and thalidomide exposed add on day 6.On the other hand the number of viable cells in the thalidomide exposed sample was increased significantly compared to that in control sample. The results suggests that the addition of thalidomide promoted the number of neurons.
Our findings help elucidate the mechanisms underlying thalidomide's teratogenicity, nerve system and may approach the safe use of this drug."
3,9,"Cardiomyocyte differentiation at an initial low density
of human induced pluripotent stem cells","In recent years, cardiomyocyte (heart muscle cells) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have received increased attention for using in medical care. Cell density is one of the important factors determining cell fate. However, the effect of cell density on cardiomyocyte differentiation remains unclear. In the previous report, we established a protocol to induce cardiomyocyte at low density to clarify the effects of seeding density [1]. In our study, we tried to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cell connect effect.
First, we validated the effect of soluble factor and the condition of Wnt inhibitor to promote cardiac differentiation. By using co-culture, cardiac differentiation promoted at low cell density. This result suggest that cardiac differentiation requires soluble factors secreted from the cells, not cell-cell contact. In addition, we confirmed earlier but not higher concentration of Wnt inhibitor addition promoted cardiac differentiation at low cell density.
Next, we verified reproductivity of the result using different hiPS cell line, 201B7-63, in a different medium, AK02, which is generally used for hiPSC a research. As a results, those cardiomyocyte

3,4,Observation of self-organizing movement using pattern culture ,"In human development, a single fertilized egg repeats cell division and forms a body. In the second week of
human development, a flat disk called the epiblast is formed. The disk is the source of the three germ layers called
mesoderm (future muscle and bone), endoderm (stomachs), and ectoderm (nerves). Self-organization occurs
according to differences in migration and adhesion abilities. However, observation of the self-organizing
movement is unclear in human. Here, to imitate an epiblast, we use human iPS cells which is equality development
stage. As a technique for imitating the epiblast, there is a technique for controlling a cell adhesion region called
1
pattern culture . Establishment of patterning techniques can contribute to the understanding of various organogenic
mesoderm and endoderm. The result showed that the movement direction of undifferentiated cells and mesoderm are random. Speed of mesoderm is faster than undifferentiated cells. Therefore, it can be seen that differentiated and undifferentiated cells have different motility and adhesion capabilities.
To observe the self-organization movement of human, our hypothesis is as follows undifferentiated cells and mesoderm, which have different motility and adhesion capabilities, were cultured on the adhesion area restricted in a disk shape, and self-organization movement will observe."
3,9,The gravity-driven microfluidics enables slow unidirectional perfusion for cell culture,"Presently, microfluidics technology is developing greatly in the field of biotechnology. microfluidics is capable of severely controlling the transportation of soluble factors and concentration gradient, microfluidics can be used to mimic in vivo conditions, which are difficult for traditional cell culture vessels [1]. We previously fabricated unidirectional perfusion microfluidics to mimic pattern formation [2]. However, generally speaking, the microfluidics experiment is not easy because the experimental handling of microfluidics is complicated and difficult. For example, the narrow channel is clogged and tube connection is complicated
In this study, we adopt the gravity-driven system microfluidics that enables the design of a wide channel and tubeless. Therefore, we set the objective of our research that is the establishment of experimental the gravity-driven system to reproduce previous research. We achieved designs and fabrication of microfluidics, slanting machine, and gravity-driven perfusion system that showed linear slanting and unidirectional perfusion. Perfusion culture using MC3T3 in microfluidics showed a normal cell survival rate after 72h.
In future work, we are going to confirm the control of the transportation of the soluble factor by perfusion culture using modify medium."
3,9,"Exploring the interactions between bacterial S46 peptidase a-helical domain and
peptides","Periodontal disease is the most common infection in the world, and periodontal pathogens have been reported to be involved in various systemic diseases. Periodontal pathogens and many related pathogens have a protein called ""S46 peptidase"" at the center of the energy supply mechanism and S46 peptidases are not found in mammals. Therefore, S46 peptidases have drawn attention as potential drug target for periodontal disease.
S46 peptidases are a member of the clan PA peptidases and are exopeptidase and catalyze the removal of dipeptides from the amino terminus of peptides. Previous study revealed the three-dimensional structure of S46 peptidase with and without peptide [1-3]. Overall structure of S46 peptidase consist of two domains. One domain has chymotrypsin fold and is responsible for catalysis. The other domain is a-helical domain and is responsible for regulatory, a-helical domain is the unique structural feature of S46 peptidases and other peptidases family do not have that domain. It is essential for designing S46 peptidases selective inhibitor to understand function of ahelical domain. So far, substrate N-terminus recognition was performed by some amino acid residues from ahelical domain. However, other interactions between substrate and a-helical domain are still unclear. In this study, we plan to explore the interaction between substrate peptide and a-helical domain by using peptide complex structures (PDB ID: 3WOL, 3WOO, 3WOR). In addition to that, we plan to conduct molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the dynamic interactions."
3,9,Microbial glucosylation of flavonol and curcumin and their mechanism of actions ,"Microbial glycosylation of plant-originated functional molecules was studied. Zygomycetous fungi Cunninghamella echinulata was found to convert 3-hydroxyflavone and its derivatives efficiently into the respective 3-O-glucosylated compounds. Biochemical study using cell-free system suggested that this process is catalyzed by glucosyltransferase in UDP-glucose-dependent manner. Polyphenols are known to show anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and other biological activities. We screened several polyphenol compounds for possible substrates of this reaction, and found that C. echinulata also shows conversion activity against curcumin from turmeric. The structure of the converted product and the mechanism of action are under investigation. These results suggested the possibility of using this fungus as catalysts to improve bioavailability of biologically functional molecules. "
3,2,"pH dependence of main chain amide nitrogen chemical shift observed by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","15N chemical shift of a main chain amide nitrogen of a protein molecule sensitively reflects the local environment surrounding the N atom in the protein molecule. HSQC spectrum reflecting N-H correlations in a protein have been utilized as an indicator to examine whether the molecule has native structure showing the typical HSQC spectrum or not, in the protein science research using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In this study, we examined how the chemical shifts of the main chain amide nitrogen of green fluorescent protein (GFP) are changed under the variant pH conditions and by the site-specific amino acid substitutions. In our experiments, 15N-labeled GFPuv in which three amino acid residues of wild-type GFP were substituted (F99S/M153T/V163A)'and with a His-tag sequence, was used a wild-type protein molecule. 15N chemical shifts of GFPuv were almost identical with those of the wild-type GFPuv registered in the databank). We have compared two-dimensional HSQC spectrum of GFPuv with that of a mutant protein."
3,2,"Calorimetric study of green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)
caused by amino acid substitution","Field: Life science Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was discovered in 1962 and was isolated for first time in the world by Dr. Atsushi Shimomura. GFP is composed pf 238 amino acids, and 11-B sheets surrounding a helix with a chromophore, GFP combined with a target protein acts as a marker to observe movement of the in vivo protein. Visualization of the movements of proteins lead to elucidation of diseases. Many GFP variants have been created and utilized for life science or medical research works, it is necessary to choose a GFP variant that can survive in the typical environment in vivo, where the target protein is expressed, such like acidic, at high or low temperature. Therefore, we need to examine the thermal stability of GFP-related proteins in various solution conditions.
In this study, GFP with three amino acid substitutions was defined as a wild-type GFP (wtGFPuv). EGFPV (F64L/S65T) with two additional amino acid substitutions to enhance green fluorescence of GFPu was prepared. wtGFPuv and EGFPuv was expressed using BL21(DE3) and purified with His-tag column. We performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiment to obtain thermodynamic parameters accompanying the thermal denaturation of wtGFPuv and EGFPuv.
Results of the DSC measurements of EGFPuv are shown in Fig. 1. Transition temperatures (Tds) of the first scans obtained with different scanning rate were not identical. This result indicates that the thermal denaturation process of EGFP (F64L/S65T) is irreversible."
3,11,Development of fall detection system for elderly people,"Recently, aging has progressed and the number of households with only elderly people has increased in Japan. Statistics Bureau announced that as of August 20, 2019, the total population is 126.24 million, of which 35.71 million are elderly people [1]. Even if there is a caregiver, it is difficult to care them all day. Because of this situation, many watching over systems for elderly have been developed. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, the elderly who are in need of care mainly suffer from falling (12.2%). Some fall detection systems use acceleration sensors. However, detection is not possible if the sensor is removed by the wearer themselves. Also, using infrared cameras or stereo cameras, it will be costly. Therefore, our system checks the state of elderly people by image processing using a web camera. If there are any abnormalities, this system notifies the care center. This system protects the lives of elderly people and reduces the burden on caregivers.
In our previous experiments, we determined that detection using optical flow is difficult due to accuracy and speed problems. Therefore, this system uses Accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE) features which are resistant to disturbances such as scale change, rotation, brightness change, and blur. In this method, the corresponding AKAZE feature values are connected by lines every several frames. ""Falling"" or ""no movement"" is detected by averaging how many degrees the lines are tilted. Based on the image resulting from the actual implementation of the AKAZE features (Fig. 1), we confirmed that the correspondence of the feature points was accurately conducted."
3,10,"Evaluation of muscle potential in upper limb muscles
during wheelchair driving by one hand drive","A wheelchair that can run straight with one hand are expected to be useful for improving the quality of life and performance in competitions (Fig.1). However, there are many unclear points about the effects of one-handed operation on physical effects and postures. So, it is necessary to provide data and indicators that are the basis for use in competition. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate muscle activity in the upper part of the body by conducting experiments to measure and observe myoelectric potential mainly in the trunk muscles.
In the experiment, three types of muscles were measured on the left and right sides (Fig.2): the standing spine, the abdominal oblique muscle, and the triceps. We analyzed them using a quantification method based on EMG calculation of myoelectric potential during driving.
As a result of experiments, it was found that there is a difference in movement between one-handed operation and two-handed operation on the standing spine. In other words, it was found that it acts on the lateral bending movement with one hand and on the anteroposterior bending movement with both hands. In the abdominal oblique muscles, it was found that the force acting on the swivel motion increased when driving with one hand. In the triceps, it was found that the amount of activity was almost the same in one hand or both hands, but it seems necessary to add a measurement target for performance evaluation.
These results provided new data on the movements of upper body muscles

3,12,Fragment-based discovery of the first nonpeptidyl inhibitor of an S46 family peptidase,"Periodontitis is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. Porphyromonas gingivalis, nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria (NF-GNB), is a major pathogen associated with the chronic form of periodontitis [1]. The dipeptidyl peptidase 11 from P. gingivalis (PgDPP11) belongs to a new class of serine peptidases, family S46 [2]. Because S46 peptidases are an important for growth of NF-GNB (Fig. 1) and not found in mammals, they are attractive targets for novel antibiotics. However, potent and selective inhibitors of these peptidases have not been developed to date. A high-resolution crystal structure analysis of PgDPP11 derived from ISS-Kibo (Fig. 2) showed that the citrate ion that mimic a substrate peptide in the Sl subsite. From in silico inhibitor screening using the citrate-based pharmacophore, an active compound SH-5 was identified. SH-5 was the first nonpeptidyl inhibitor of S46 peptidases and showed an inhibitory effect against the growth of P. gingivalis. Thus, SH-5 could be lead structures for the development of selective inhibitors of PgDPP11."
4,8,Management of “KOSEN Startup Community” ,"“KOSEN Startup Community” is a platform for highly motivated students of KOSEN. Because highly motivated students are minority in KOSEN, it is difficult catch a team member for a new challenge. In order to solve this situation, we manage “KOSEN Startup Community”. They can catch a team member by participating in this community and can challenge something. Moreover, they can raise technical skill each other by sharing technical knowledge, facilities and talented person.
“KOSEN Startup Community” work on three following content mainly.
1. Hackathons to solve various problems.
2. The venture school by the person who plays an active role in the front line of the company.
3. KOSEN FabLab. (FabLab is a place equipped with digital manufacturing facilities.)
As conventional activity, a hackathon to solve problems about the agriculture of Africa was held in Kitakyushu KOSEN last May by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency). About 60 students gathered for this hackathon from six KOSEN and discussed about four problems for two days. Winners of this hackathon made prototype and went to Africa to demonstrate by support from JICA.
In addition, providing KOSEN FabLab for students, they can use digital manufacturing facilities like 3D printer and laser cutter freely. Using those facilities, they can raise technical skill naturally in a process making product which they want to make.
In this way, we provide the place that is easier to challenge and promote the growth of student. And, we hope that students who grew up in this community will pull innovation in the future."
4,10,Automatic Generation of Supplementary Conjunction Questions for Learners of Japanese,"We are currently building a system that automatically generates reading comprehension questions for Japanese
texts in order to support students (especially international students) who are learning Japanese. We have already developed systems that automatically generate supplementary noun/verb phrase questions, conversational sentence rearrangement questions, and supplementary questions on frequently appearing words. In this research, we focus on conjunctions, which often appear in Japanese sentences and have complicated types and usage patterns, in an attempt to automatically generate supplementary conjunction questions that require the indication of conjunctions appropriate for Japanese sentences. In addition to helping instructors develop reading comprehension tests, this system can be used to support the autonomous learning of students of Japanese.
2. Automatic Question Generation System
We first conducted a survey on Japanese language conjunctions that are both often used and not considerably
vague. Since this system is designed for learners of Japanese, infrequently used conjunctions with unique expressions or phraseologies were not used in the questions. We used the 2013 Mainichi Shimbun, fairytale collections, and Aozora Bunko novels as our corpus to identify frequently appearing conjunctions and then categorized them according to usage.
The questions themselves were extracted from this corpus, specifically from sentences of appropriate length that included certain conjunctions. If a sentence contained a conjunction at its beginning, we would extract a certain part of the previous sentence and combine it with the sentence containing the conjunction into a single sentence. We also set a size limit for the previous sentences used in these cases. Regarding how the groups of alternative answers were created, for each question, we extracted the three misleading answers from each of the three categories to which the correct answer did not belong. It is important to use the syntactic information of the questions themselves to select appropriate misleading answers in order to avoid generating questions for which multiple answers may seem correct."
4,9,The Verification of Correlation between English ability and Eye Movement in Reading Process using Eye Tracking,"We aim to estimate the effective level of English books and learners’ English language ability from gaze trends instantly, by clarifying the relationships between eye movements and English ability. We examine objective and quantitative analytical method using eye tracking about eye movements when learners with different English language ability read English sentences. Based on our previous research, it seems that thedifficulty of English sentences affects reader's eye movement and reading speed
In this study, we investigate whether there is any correlation between the reader's eye movements when they
read extensive reading sentences of multiple difficulty levels and reader's English language ability. In this time, in order to verify correlation between the eye movements when the participants reading English sentences and reader's English ability, we used English sentences displayed on PC's screen, and eye tracker. As a result of the experiment, it considered that there is some correlation between English language ability and some eye movement data such as fixation time, pupil diameter and reading speed."
4,9,A Quantitative Evaluation Method of Student’s Concentration Using Deep Learning ,"In recent years, remote education has significantly attracted great interests. In conventional education, teachers often communicate with their students in both verbal and non-verbal ways. Such communication is realized by teacher’s feeling for their student's status such as concentration. The felt status is feedbacked to the progress of class towards fostering a well atmosphere to get educational efforts. However, communications in remote education between students and teachers are significantly harder, because it is difficult for teachers to recognize their student’s emotion through remote devices.
To tackle this problem in remote education, we propose a system to quantitatively evaluate student's concentration in classrooms. The system employs a deep neural network which estimates human's emotion in Russell's circumplex model of affect[1] shown in Figure 1. The network takes human's face image as an input and outputs emotion in valence and arousal measures. We use these measures to analyze student's face in classrooms. The goal of this research is to differentiate “Concentrating face” and “not concentrating face” using the valence and arousal measures.
BasicperformanceverificationexperimentwasconductedusingfacialimagesofyoungJapaneseman. Figure 5 shows the output of the network for each input of Figures 2, 3 and 4. From the output result shown in Figure 5, we can see that the system is correctly recognizing facial expressions."
4,9,EEG Trend Analysis for English Language Ability Estimation ,"Today, globalization is advancing all over the world and communication ability in English is necessary. There are three important factors in language learning: input, output, and feedback. The appropriate feedback is especially important to improve English language ability. To measure English ability, more immediately and objectively, we focus on brain waves and consider the new method to estimate the English language ability.
We measured and analyzed brain waves when the participants read English sentences. We used Polymate Pro MP6000 (Miyuki Giken) to measure participants’ brain waves. After one-minute English reading, the participants rest for one-minute with their eyes closed. We used 10 books of 5 levels.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the analysis results. The vertical axis represents α wave / β wave. The horizontal axis represents difficulty of the English sentences. The difficulty of sentences rose from 1 to 5. When the reader is relaxed, it is said that the value of α wave / β wave becomes higher, so it can be considered that the reader felt comfortable on reading sentences
Figure 1 shows that the values of α wave / β wave of brain waves of participants with the TOEIC score of 680 or higher. This group has minimum peaks of difficulty 3 or higher levels. Figure 2 shows that the values of α wave / β wave of brain waves of participants with the TOEIC score of 470 or more and less than 680. This group has minimum peaks of difficulty 1, 2 and 4. From these results, we can say that there is a tendency that the difficulty level of the minimum peak changes depending on the TOEIC score of the participants."
4,17,An Educational Tool to Enrich an Ability of Map Navigation ,"There are some conventional education methods through some plays with painting or clay in primary school lessons in order to cultivate creativity. Children like to handwrite objects in their imagination so that they can concentrate for these creating tasks for a long time. A maze play is one of them. Therefore the purpose of this study was to develop an interactive educational system for providing virtual space based on a maze drawn on a paper by children themselves. The system needs a preprocessing to create the virtual labyrinthine. As the first step in education, the learner draws a maze on an A4 size paper by himself as is shown in Fig.1. As the second step, the paper is scanned and converted to a digital graphic file. As the third step, the handwritten lines on the paper are recognized as three dimensional virtual walls in the virtual labyrinthine automatically by using image recognition technology. As the final step, the output file is written into HD. The output file is read to play in the virtual labyrinthine streets. The each learner can go toward a goal of labyrinthine streets drawn by myself in virtual space. The gaming engine Unity enables learners to walk through the virtual space. The learner can access to the virtual space by using the head mounted display system. The learners can arrange some monsters on the virtual streets to enhance their motivations toward to their goals. The system was composed of virtual reality head mounted display “Oculus Rift” (Oculus Rift 2018), a pair of Oculus Touch, and a Windows PC. A DELL ALIENWARE Area-51 15Q42 and the graphic board GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GAMING X 11G were selected to create and draw 3DCG objects in real time. Oculus Touch was used to manage both the movement of the learner and the line of sight in virtual world.

 The system was implemented by using Unity version 2018.1.0f2 (Unity 2018). The code was written in C# language. Unity is a useful game engine in order to create a virtual reality space. It was demonstrated that the system can create the virtual labyrinthine streets and the user can go toward a goal of labyrinthine streets. The learner can access to the virtual space by using the head mounted display system by using an Oculus Rift. In this study, virtual enemies are reproduced in the virtual world to enhance the motivations to aim their goals. As the result, the interactive educational system enables learners to fight a brave battle against enemies."

Introduction In our previous study we got that the brains of students exhibited a higher level of activation in the Active Learning classes than the conventional lecture classes and the number of blinks exhibited a deeper concentration. This time, we will investigate a correlation between the biological data of students in AL classes and changes of activities in the class. Our second aim is to observe how affect the concentration according to timings that students will get answers.. 2. Experimental Methods
Figure 1: Group Work We conducted a 75-minute Mathematics classes for the experiment. Eight students who are 16-17 years old were split in two groups of four. To the first group the teacher hands the answer of their work from the beginning of their work, while to the second group she hands it after a while their work has started. Through out the class, the strength and the speed of eye blinks and the head movement of three students were tracked with a special type of glasses (JINS MEME, n.d.).
3. Results & Discussion Figure 1 shows the strength of students' eyeblinks. The vertical lines in figure 1 indecate the timmings of class activities change. We can observe that strengths got stable right after the period D, E, G started. That means students got into concentrate. Table 1 shows the result of F-test for these stabilities. The p-values in blue and yellow cells show that students get concentrated or not. This result mainly ensures our observation. Furthermore we can see that the first group students (Student 1,2) kept their concentration but the second group student (Student 3) didn't.
4. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the students got into concentrated in tune with changing the activities in the class.

– Preliminarry experiment of Snow Depth Measurement on Roads and Roadsides –","Currently, snow disaster preventions are indispensable in cold regions and snow cover regions in Japan for the sake of the sustainable society. Among the snow disaster preventions, securing road transportation is especially important to sustain the socio-economic activity.
The importance is expanding not only in the Japan Sea coast and the midcontinent, but also in the Pacific Coast in Japan. Particularly, it is Fukushima that the very important area to monitor is. Because Fukushima is located around the border of cold regions and snow cover regions which is sensitive due to the recent climate change.
Authors have developed a Vehicle-Mounted LiDAR system and have started snow survey operation along the road since 2018-2019 winter season.

4,17,4th STI-GIGAKU 2019: The English Learner’s Lab (TELL) Program at NUT (Abstract) ,"Learning a foreign language requires an extensive amount of time and input. As such, we think it is necessary to implement programs outside of class rooms for students that would increase English language input. Further, by emphasizing the learning of phrases and words that are used in daily life conversations, students will come to see learning English as not solely an academic activity but having practical utility and thus be further motivated.
Listening has an important role both in daily life and academic context as it is a crucial part of effective communication. In spite of its importance, listening was not considered integral to language curricula in the past. However, in recent years, with the emphasis on communication in teaching languages, listening as a skill is receiving much more attention. Further, English learners need to be exposed to and be familiarized with different accents so as to prepare them to communicate with a variety of speakers in an increasingly global work environment.
The TELL Program at NUT is built around English-language videos at multiple levels of difficulty as well as containing a variety of accents. A cloud storage system is used to store past and future videos so participants may view it at their own convenience. Many of the videos also have subtitles in Japanese and English, which is helpful in a self-study scenario. The topics range from daily conversations in comedy shows to subjects that are interesting for technology students (e.g. TED videos). After watching a video, participants discuss the content with each other, or are given simple questions to answer. A foreign student with adequate Japanese and English communication skill acts as the facilitator of the session. This enables participants to discuss, answer questions or get further clarification on phrases, words or the cultural context in either English or Japanese or both.
Currently the number of participants range from 5 to 12 people, depending on the specific video, the difficulty level, and other campus activities on a given day. Participation is not limited to students - staff and teachers who are interested to learn English also attend the session. Attendance is voluntary.
We have observed increased use of English among consistent attendees. Beginners have shown an interest in employing English during discussions, whereas more advanced learners ask questions about the speech patterns and the cultural context in other parts of the world. Attendees mentioned that they find it challenging to understand the meaning of jokes and slang terms used in comedy and science fiction shows.
Future plans for the program include increasing both the number of participants and the level of interaction in English. One option to encourage student attendance is to align the program with English classes (e.g. mandatory TELL attendance for certain courses, showing videos related to material used in classes, etc.). Consistent participation will enable comparing the language proficiency of program participants versus non-participants in listening comprehension, verbal communication and TOEIC scores."
4,17,Extensive Reading Marathon in the Second Year ,"A large amount of English input is required to acquire English. However, it is difficult for an English learner who is studying in an environment where there are few opportunities to learn English outside classes to obtain enough input. Further, many students in our university feel their English ability is not good enough; therefore, we think that it is necessary to implement activities to increase the amount of the input not only in the limited class but also outside the class.
In order for students to study English outside the class, the learning method must be simple, enjoyable, and make them realize the effect of improving their English proficiency. Furthermore, a certain amount of time is required to increase the amount of the input. Considering these problems, Extensive Reading and Listening Marathon was introduced last year.
It is a learning method that allows students to select an English book that suits their English ability as well as their interests, and to read for pleasure. This is the background that led to the establishment of the Extensive Reading and Listening. The purpose of this activity is to increase the amount of input in English. In last year's activities, they allocated extensive reading and listening to half of activity time. Therefore, it can be said that a certain amount of the input was gained. However, as the points to be improved this year’s activity, we can say that, the number of participants gradually decreased, there were few chances to use English and there were no materials to take over in the activity.
Therefore, we aim to build up our own language resources by acquiring the habit of voluntarily speaking English, and to provide an opportunity to actually use English gained by extensive reading. Based on these objectives, we have carried out activities devised by the leader students after the first 30-minute ER. Also, by providing an opportunity to use English, we expect that the participants’ English resources will be established, and that they can actively be involved in the activity. In addition, we thought that this year's activity flow could be visualized and the activities of the next year could be carried out smoothly by creating materials such as the minutes of regular meetings and schedules of activities.
We are creating materials and preparing for takeover. Although we have carried out our activities, the number of participants has been decreasing again this year. The increase in the number of participants brings vitality to the activities and makes participants eager to learn English by encouraging each other. The reverse is also true. Therefore, in the next semester, we plan to carry out activities that will make students interested in English, such as having lectures on Overseas Practical Training, which is a feature of our university, by an experienced senior and inviting foreign students as lecturers."
5,4,"Kawaii Rika Project
~Challenge against decline in student's positive attitude toward science~","In Japanese education society, “decline in student's positive attitude toward science” was discussed since late 1980s. However, the situation has not been improved. In particular, the situation in female students and researchers in science and engineering societies are remarkably serious. For example, the ratio of female doctors in Japan is 20% in 2015, the smallest in the OECD 32 countries [1].
Kawaii Rika Project has been established to solve the problem in 2014 in Nagaoka University of Technology. We focused on the feeling of “Kawaii” to make science and engineering familiar for women and children. A Japanese word “Kawaii” has a similar meaning to “cute” or “pretty” in English, but includes an appetite for approaching and touching.
We have proposed new concept to mix “Kawaii” and “Rika (science in Japan)”. The Kawaii Rika project is promoting some activities as follows:
➢ Activities in Japan
⚫ School festival in Nagaoka University of Technology
⚫ School festival in National Institute of Technology, Kobe College and Kitakyushu
⚫ Science event in Nagaoka City Hall Plaza Ao-re Nagaoka
⚫ 5th Funny Science Festival in National Institute of Technology, Miyakonozyo
➢ Activities in foreign countries
⚫ Workshop in Hanoi University of Science and Technology (in Vietnam)

A millimeter-wave sensor is used to measure the water level of rivers with high accuracy. In order to develop a robust antenna for unnecessary signal, we propose the slot antenna with frequency selectivity by combining FSS (Frequency Selective Surfaces) which transmits or shields radio waves in a specific frequency band. In this study, to design FSS shape, TO (Topology Optimization) using NGnet (Normalized Gaussian network) is carried out. The modeling of the analysis region and the calculation is performed by using FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) method.
2. Analysis conditions and TO using NGnet
The analysis region is shown in Fig.1. The analysis frequency is 12 GHz, the cell size is 0.5[mm], and the analysis region is 700×100×100 cells. The slot hole whose size is 2×12.5 mm is drilled in the center of the metal plate. FSS is located in front of the slot. The transmission characteristics S21 is calculated by applying sinusoidally modulated gaussian pulse as an incident wave.
Next, TO using the NGnet is described. TO is the design method to control the shape of an object in a cell unit. NGnet uses the Gaussian function as a basis function to smoothly group the cells

3. Optimization results
The objective function of TO is determined so that only the frequency band of 11.8~12.2 [GHz] can be transmitted. The Number of Gaussian basis per F of FSS is defined by n×n, where n = 3, 5, and 7. When only the slot are arranged, the frequency selectivity is not observed. In contrast, when the slot combining FSS, the transmission characteristics is improved in the frequency band around 12 GHz. Figure 3 shows the optimized shape of FSS when n = 5. It is shown that the proposed method can provide frequency selectivity to the slot antenna. Also, the deviation of the transmission frequency band can be reduced by giving the objective function exactly. In addition, when the distance l between the slot and FSS is increased, the amount of transmission tends to decrease.

6,13,Fundamental study on development novel design method combining topology optimization and machine learning for dielectric lens antenna ,"1. Introduction
The purpose of this study is to develop novel shape design method combining the topology optimization and the machine learning for the dielectric lens for antenna aiming high accuracy water level measurement [1]. The topology optimization for designing dielectric lens shows high designing performance but has heavy computational cost. The prior study using the machine learning for 2D topology optimization of motor structure has been shown that the calculation speed can be accelerated by skipping the low evaluation individuals [2]. To skip them, it is necessary to generate high performance classifier. In this study, we examine the way of linking the identified pictures with objective function (OF) of topology optimization for generating classifier.
2. Overview of topology optimization using machine learning
The overall flow of this study is shown in Fig.1. We have installed until the first and second steps: building neural network and creating data set, where the neural network is VGG-16 and the data set is lens shape picture generated by the topology optimization. The output layer of VGG-16 is restricted using the transfer learning. In the third step, we need to develop to embed the machine learning in the topology optimization program.
First, we try to link the data set of the identified pictures with OF value. OF value, which is the maximum radiation power from the antenna with the dielectric lens in this study, is extracted from the topology optimization history data. Next, the classifier to evaluate and skip the individuals is developed. The data which is linked to OF is labeled by each rank, as shown in Fig.2, and stored in the classifier.
Now, we are making new labels that is set each rank for machine learning. In the future work, we are planning to combine the topology optimization program written by C++ program and the machine learning program written by Python by using shell script.

6,13,DEVELOPMENT OF MILLIMETER WAVE WATER LEVEL DETECTOR USING HORN ANTENNA WITH TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZED RADOME,"INTRODUCTION
A millimeter wave sensor is used widely for many applications such as the automotive radar. Recently, a water level sensor of river with high accuracy has attracted a lot of attention among millimeter wave applications. For practical use, the dielectric radome is required in order to protect the antenna from rain and snow. However, when the dielectric radome is loaded, the antenna gain is decreased, then the measurement distance is shortened. In this study, we aim to maximize the antenna gain by shape design of the dielectric radome using 3D topology optimization[1]. The relationship between the radome design region and the radiation property is examined.
  2.
OPTIMIZATION OF DIELECTRIC RADOME
Figure 1 shows the design region of dielectric radome. The standard horn antenna (Millitech SGH-10, WR-10 standard) are modeled by FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) cell unit which is 0.4 mm. All cells in the design region are set either the dielectric or air. The dielectric in this study is Polylactic acid (PLA,r=2.6).
The height of the design region is set to 25 cells (10 mm) and the reference region is embedded into the antenna. To clarify the relation between the radome position and the radiation property, we carry out the topology optimization of the radome shape as shifting the radome position where the shifted distance is x.
When the design region is shifted from 2 to 10 mm, H-plane far field radiation patterns and the optimized radome shape are shown in Fig.2 and Fi.3, respectively. From these results, it is found that the antenna gain is increase when x is larger than 6 mm."
6,14,Attempt at enrichment culture of DPANN archaea under methanogenic condition ,"Archaea widely exist in various environments such as soil, freshwater, ocean, deep sea, ground water, and hot spring, and play significant role in the earth’s geochemical carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. For industries, Archaea, especially methanogens, are essential key players for anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies. While Archaea are important microorganisms for several natural and artificial environments, most of archaeal physiologies are still unknown due to the difficulty of isolation and cultivation from natural sources. In recent advances of DNA sequencing technologies, culture-independent approaches such as metagenomics and single-cell genomics have revealed the novel archaeal metabolisms. In recent archaeal genome analyses, Archaea belonging to DPANN (Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanohaloarchaeota and Nanoarchaeota) superphylum have been frequently studied, and these archaea have small cell, genome size, and limited metabolic pathway, and closely exits with other archaeal cells. These results suggest that DPANN might be symbiont. In recent our studies, we newly found 16S rRNA gene sequences of DPANN archaea from methanogenic environments (anaerobic bioreactors treating artificial phenol wastewater and purified terephthalic acid wastewater and an anaerobic digester), which are distantly related to known DPANN archaeal sequences. While several genomic approaches performed to speculate functions of DPANN archaea, their actual physiologies are still unknown due to limited enrichment co-cultures (Nanoarchaeota and Micarchaeota). In addition, DPANN archaea under methanogenic condition are completely veiled due to lack of ecological information.
In this study, to enrich the DPANN archaea under methanogenic condition, we prepared anaerobic inorganic media with different substrates (H2/CO2, formate, acetate, methanol & H2, and phenol). Seed sludge was collected from upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating artificial polyethylene terephthalate manufacturing wastewater. Cultivation was performed at 37oC under stational condition. To check growth of targeted DPANN archaea, we performed measurement of methane production by gas chromatography and determination of DPANN archaea and host cells using phase contrast and Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method. Besides, we confirmed the abundance rate of enriched DPANN archaea by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis using Illumina Miseq. The results of our enrichment cultivation indicated that we confirmed growth of DPANN archaea in cultures with acetate, methanol & H2, and phenol as substrates. In addition, small active cells that closely exist with archaeal cells were confirmed by FISH analysis using ARC915 probe."
6,14,Inactivation of Vibrio fischeri in the Ocean by Pulsed Electric Field ,"The pulsed electric field (PEF) method, which is cited as one of physical non-thermal sterilization methods, enables a continuous treatment with a simple structure. Since this method hardly causes protein denaturation, it can be used to sterilize eggs, fish, and the like, if its bactericidal strength and energy efficiency can be improved. In this study, the ability of pulsed electric field to sterilize Vibrio fischeri (V. fischeri) was examined. When the current applied to V. fischeri was limited, it was impossible to sterilize the bacteria even when the applied voltage and applied time were increased up to 13 kV and 15 minutes, respectively. Subsequently, when helium flow was used to increase the current to V. fischeri, sterilization was confirmed when the applied voltage was 13 kV and the applied time was 5 minutes or more (Fig. 1). In this report, we show that sterilization could be confirmed by measuring the temperature and applying voltage at 20 °C or lower, indicating that sterilization was achieved due to factors other than heat."
6,9,Optimization of copper-free click chemistry FISH for applying microorganisms,"Field: Environment Engineering Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a detecting technique for environmental microorganisms (DeLong et al. 1989). Especially, FISH has been used for single-cell genome analysis to reveal the metabolic level and identify of microorganisms. On the other hand, the signal intensity of FISH is not enough for environmental microorganisms. This is because the signal intensity depends on the amount of rRNA present in the cells of the target microorganisms, and the target microorganisms living in rRNA inhabiting the oligotrophic environment is small. To solve this problem, several high-sensitivity FISHs have been developed. Catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD)-FISH has been reported to have a signal intensity 26 to 41 times that of standard FISH (Hoshino, et al., 2008). Moreover, quick hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-FISH has been reported as a high-sensitivity FISH that does not require cell wall treatment (Yamaguchi, et al., 2015). However, CARD-FISH still uses hydrogen peroxide, and its reagent can damage DNA. Also, the signal intensity of HCR-FISH is not enough for environmental microorganisms. So far, no efficient high-sensitivity FISHs have been reported.
In this study, we will introduce our high-sensitivity FISH applicable to single-cell genome analysis. This uses a bond reaction between azide and BCN, which is one of
DAPI Signal Probe Signal the biological orthogonal reactions called copper-free click chemistry. The novel FISH was applied to Escherichia coli as a pure culture strain.

6,12,A Sequential Anaerobic – Aerobic Biological System for Textile Wastewater Treatment,"Reactive dye has been known as one of the most successful modern synthetic dyes applied to the textile industry [1]. However, serious environmental problems stem from the existence of these dyes and their breakdown products in textile wastewater. In other words, an increasing amount of highly colored effluent can pose threats to the natural environment, specifically, be toxic to aquatic life [2]. Thus, appropriate wastewater treatment systems for decolorization have been extremely necessary. Among the current methods applied, biological methods, especially, the sequential anaerobic-aerobic method can be seen a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to mineralize completely azo dyes which make up 60–70% of all dyes [3]. Therefore, in our study, a laboratory-scale system combining an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR, the total volume of 10 L) with a down-flow hanging sponge reactor (DHS, the total volume of 4.14 L) was conducted to treat artificial dyeing wastewater at 300C with 23 hours of hydraulic retention time for ABR reactor. Commercial dyes named HSR Reactive Black, a mix of Vinyl sulphone- reactive dyes, and starch were included in synthetic influent to adjust to 4,070 ± 464 (using colorimeter) and 1,010 ± 70 Pt/Co (using spectrometer) of color levels, and 270 ± 85 mg/L of total COD concentration. Approximately 78.3% ± 8.7% of total COD was removed by the ABR-DHS system, with the most significant reduction in the ABR reactor. Meanwhile, the whole treatment process achieved roughly 60.7% ± 4.9% (using colorimeter) and 47.9% ± 3.1% (using spectrometer) of color removals. Under these results, we believe that the system has a huge potential for treating real dye wastewater on an industrial scale. Furthermore, some treatments with activated carbon, sodium hypochlorite, and ozone addition to ABR-DHS effluent posed some positive results. "

The hydrogel properties were determined via SEM, FTIR, XRD viscosity, viscoelasticity, equilibrium water content (EWC) and water contact angle (WCA). The results showed that physical and chemical properties of Cellulose hydrogel were relatively high in EWC with more 85% in each hydrogels. The cellulose hydrogel at higher concentration of Lici showed the increment in the term of elastic and mechanical properties. The tensile strength was enhanced from 328.4 to 515.9 KPa for the celluloes hydrogel containing 3 and 7 wt% of Lici.

6,14,Bacterial Pathogens removal in Downflow Hanging Sponge Reactor and Conventional Activated Sludge Process ,"For this study, two municipal wastewater treatment systems, Downflow Hanging Sponge (DHS) reactor and Conventional Activated Sludge Process (CAS) were selected. The DHS reactor is a trickling filter that uses a polyurethane-sponge media to carry biomass (Onodera et al.,2014). Wastewater trickles from the top of the reactor and is oxidized by the prokaryotes within and on the surface of the sponge medium as it flows down through the reactor by gravity. The objective of this study was to check the removal capacity of individual genes of bacterial pathogens by both the treatment systems. Microbial detection techniques like Colilert method and Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) were utilized to monitor the removal of pathogenic species adapted from the study by Ishii et al., (2013). Out of eight strains only three namely, E. coli, EHEC and C. perfringens were confirmed positive. The other bacteria species such as Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella pneumophila and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in the sample. In order words, only five targeted genes of three strains were detected positive. The overall removal performance of each treatment units was evaluated by comparing the effluent and influent concentrations. The results as shown in Table 1 revealed that the removal rate of E. coli and EHEC by DHS reactor and CAS were almost similar. However, for C. perfringens, CAS accounting 99% showcased better removal than DHS accounting 98%, owing to resistance to straining and adsorption in DHS reactor. Nevertheless, studies on pathogens in different systems could be useful
to establish standards for policies on wastewater management."
6,13,"Improvement of accuracy of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) C-band radar by using a deep learning ","There are two types of dams in Japan. One is a dam managed by the Japanese government, and the other is a dam (Hereafter, this dam is called subsidy dam.) managed by prefectural government with subsidies from the Japanese government. Most subsidies dams have poor measured precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) data, and the basin area are small. Therefore, there is a possibility that there is a problem in the dam operation because appropriate spatial distribution of precipitation has not been measured. Furthermore, it is necessary to measure precipitation high frequently because water flows into the dam in short time. Appropriate spatial rainfall data with high frequency is needed in the dam operation. Purpose of this study developed the algorithm for high accuracy of the MLIT C-band radar with high frequency by using a deep learning.
For the purpose, a correction technique of the MLIT C-band radar developed in the previous study was further improved, and rainfall prediction technology was developed in this study. The target basin of this study was the upstream area of the Sagurigawa Dam, and SONY Neural Network Console was used as deep learning tool. Improvement of accuracy of MLIT C-band radar was examined with convolutional neural network model of deep leaning. MLIT C-band radar was corrected by using Japan meteorological agency analytical rainfall as correct data. The technology to predict rainfall was developed by using recurrent neural network model of deep leaning. This time, rainfall was predicted with 5minutes time interval at one point within the basin in this study."
6,15,Development of an In-situ Heavy Metal-Contaminated Groundwater Treatment Technique by Using Biomineralized CaCO3 ,"Heavy metal-contaminated soils and groundwater have become a common problem in the world [1]. The major problem of the excavation-removal method, a conventional heavy metal remediation technique, would be high cost for the complete remediation or the high risk of releasing toxic heavy metals to other environments. In addition, the application of excavation-removal method is difficult, where a heavy metal contaminated site below structures. In this study, we evaluated the potential applicability of an in-situ heavy metal-contaminated groundwater treatment technique based on the heavy metal adsorption capacity of biomineralized CaCO3. We successfully isolated strain WKDN with aerobic denitrification and CaCO3 biomineralization capabilities from soil. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the dominant component of precipitates produced in-vitro by strain WKDN was calcite. 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis suggested that this strain is an Acinetobacter species. The result obtained from a sand column experiment indicated that dissolved zinc (Zn) can be effectively removed by CaCO3 biomineralized by strain WKDN (Fig. 1). Overall our data suggested that the described biomineralized CaCO3-based method has good application prospects for the in-situ treatment of heavy metal-contaminated groundwater. "
6,9,Analysis of Microbial Diversity in Activated Sludge of A/O MBR in Low Organic Loading rate under Different Temperature Condition ,"In recent years, Membrane Bioreactor have been proposed in wastewater treatment field because of the advantages such as compact occupying area, High volume loading rate, good effluent quality. The main obstacle for wide application of MBR has been membrane fouling, which causes functional deterioration such as permeation flux decrease. In this study, the influence of difference in the microbial community structure of activated sludge on the membrane fouling of the membrane bioreactor (MBR) under low organic loading rate conditions were investigated.
We operated two MBRs (Fig.1) on exact same period under low temperature condition of RL (12.9°C) and high temperature conditions of RH1 and RH2 (25.8°C and 26.3°C), respectively. During the MBR operation, periodically collecting the activated sludge samples and the membrane surface biofilm and sludge samples, where membrane fouling occurred, were collected and analyzed the microbial community structure based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. As the result, membrane fouling was developed under RL and RH1 conditions. The microbial diversity of activated sludge on each condition (Fig.2) suggested that stable microbial diversity in middle period was important for fouling control in comparison between RH1 and RH2. In the RL condition, an uncultured OD1 bacteria was predominant in the biofilm, and TM6 bacteria was predominant in the biofilm of RH1condition MBR. On the other hand, “Candidatus Promineofilum” (phylum Chloroflexi), which is reported as EPS degradation bacteria, was predominant genus in the MBR of RH2 condition and it was thought that it might be leads to membrane fouling control."

7,9,Combustion characteristics of biogas-oxygen counterflow diffusion microflames ,"Recently, biogas composed of methane and carbon dioxide has attracted attention as one of renewable energy. However, biogas is not widely used because of its low calorie. To use low calorie biogas, oxygen combustion is adopted as one of the effective methods, where the flame temperature is higher than that of air combustion. We adopt diffusion flames to perform oxygen combustion where there is no flashback. We want to utilize a microflame in a compact energy conversion device which is expected to be used as an emergency power source.
In our previous study, flammable range of burner gap, flame thickness and flame diameter were measured in biogas-oxygen counterflow diffusion microflames when burners were installed vertical and horizontal directions. The inner diameter of burner is 0.3 and 0.5mm, and outer diameter is 1.59mm. Flow rate of biogas is 4, 5, 6 and 7 mL / min, and the equivalent ratio is set to unity. The mixing ratio, defined as the methane flow rate relative to the total flow rate of methane and carbon dioxide, is 1.0, 0.67, 0.50 and 0.40. The basic characteristics of microflames such as flammable range and flame stretch effects were revealed in our previous study.
In our present study, we investigate the combustion characteristics when the flame is covered with a glass tube. The inner diameter of glass tube is 5, 10 and 15 mm, the thickness is 1-1.5 mm, and the length is 60 mm. The flammable range extends in most conditions, compared with the case of no glass tube. In particular, the flammable region extends greatly when the flow rate is small and the mixing ratio is low. It can be used for energy conversion device by replacing the glass tube with thermoelectric elements."
7,9,AI-based thermal design of electronic devices ,"The heat generation density of electronic devices has increased due to the device miniaturization and the computational performance improvement. High heat generation density causes high temperature of electronic components, decreasing the long-term reliability of the electronic devices. The thermal design is an important design step for the electronic devices. However, trials and errors based on the designer’s experience are the mainstream of the current thermal design. is needed.
The purpose of this study is to develop a more intelligent thermal design method based on artificial intelligent (AI) technology. As for the first step of the development, we try to optimize the arrangement of electronic components on the circuit board and to find the arrangement with the smallest thermal load. We create a mathematical model in MATLAB/Simulink. The temperature of the components and the board is calculated by using the thermal network method. Figure 1 shows the outlines of the mathematical model and the corresponding thermal circuit in Simulink. In Fig. 1 (a), the number of components is three for example. In Fig. 1 (b), each components are connected in a thermal circuit. By applying Bayesian optimization to this model, the optimal component placement which minimized the thermal load is searched. We will report the results of some test optimizations and discuss the advantages of the present method in comparison with the conventional method."

When the gap between the ring-shaped flat plate and the circular cylinder blade is in a certain range, either one of the trailing vortex or the necklace vortex generated in the crossshaped cylinder / flat plate system is formed in the vicinity of the intersection of the circular cylinder blade and the ring-shaped flat plate. When a necklace vortex is formed, the circular cylinder blade firstly rocks and turns and starts to rotate at a constant angular velocity as a trigger. As a result, the circular cylinder blades steadily rotate at a constant angular velocity, and the steady lift due to the longitudinal vortex is generated.

7,9,Fabrication and test of 3D curved photovoltaic module ,"In recent years, the promotion of solar energy utilization technologies such as solar power generation (Photovoltaics: PV) and solar heat has been an issue for the reduction of CO2 emissions. The research and development of PV technology are being promoted around the world.[1] One of the efforts is to supply a clean power directly to the car by installing a PV system into the car and utilizing it as a power source. A PV module consists of crystalline Si solar cells is a candidate for vehicle applications because it is low-cost and high performance. The conventional PV module flat, however the PV module should be three-dimensionally (3D) curved for the car body. The 3D curved PV module should be smooth as possible from the viewpoint of cleaning and design. A big issue when one tries to mount a fragile crystalline Si solar cell on a 3D curved smooth surface, is that the Si solar cell may break.[2]
The purpose of this study is to develop the method of adapting the crystalline Si solar cell to the 3D curved surface, and to investigate the effect of the curved surface on the power generation of the 3D curved PV module. As an attempt, the Si solar cell was cut into a triangle as shown in Fig.1. Changing the shape of the Si solar cell from the conventional square to non-square shape might be a solution for 3D curved surface adaption. The triangle Si cells were attached on a 3D curved glass. We will report some results of the fundamental performance tests using the prototype 3D curved modules."
7,9,Optimal control of tracking bifacial photovoltaic system based on reinforcement learning,"This study describes the optimal control of tracking bifacial photovoltaic system based on reinforcement learning. The tracking bifacial photovoltaic system is equipped with a bifacial photovoltaic panel that can generate power from sunlight entering both the front and back sides of the panel. In the conventional sun-tracking control, the panel surface is always directed to the sun to maximize the solar energy gain to the panel. However, the conventional sun-tracking control is not always the best for the bifacial photovoltaic system. For example, if the reflectance of the ground is high, and the ratio of the reflected sunlight increases, the solar energy gain may increase when the direction of the panel surface is shifted from the sun. On cloudy days, diffuse component of sunlight increases and is incident on the panel from all directions. In this case, the solar energy gain may increase when the panel surface is directed to the zenith. In this study, a reinforcement learning is used to optimally control the direction of the tracking bifacial photovoltaic panel. Reinforcement learning control maximizes the solar energy gain, i.e., the power generation by learning the relationships among the tracking angle, date and time, amount of solar radiation, and power generation output. The advantages of the present method is examined in comparison with the conventional sun-tracking control method."
7,9,Optimal design and control of 3D curved photovoltaic module for vehicle applications ,"Research and development of solar power generation using solar energy as a countermeasure against global warming has been promoted in various countries around the world. In addition, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles are expected to spread in the future in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Recently, as shown in Fig. 1, the use of photovoltaics (PV) modules as on-board power sources in vehicles has been studied [1], and this is expected to reduce exhaust emissions from vehicles. When a PV module is installed in a vehicle, it must be applied to a 3-dimensional (3D) curved surface. In the 3D curved surface, the solar radiation distribution is non-uniform at the PV module, and the power generation decreases compared to the flat PV module. Generally, bypass diodes (BPDs) are implemented in the PV module to suppress the reduction in power generation due to non-uniform solar radiation distribution, however, the optimal design of BPDs placement and the optimal maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method in the 3D curved PV module have not been studied to date.
In this study, the mathematical model of the 3D curved PV module is created in MATLAB/Simulink platform, and the optimal design simulations are carried out. The PV module is modeled by connecting solar cells (equivalent circuit of solar cell, Fig.2) in series or in parallel with BPDs. Patterns of BPDs placement and characteristic of maximum power point are examined under various non-uniform irradiance and cell temperature conditions. Finally, the optimal number and position of BPDs are determined by a deep reinforcement learning based on the da"
7,9,Validation of Accuracy Improvement Effect and Factor of Precision Measuring Robot Using Electromagnet by Vibration Analysis ,"Precision surface roughness measurement in electric power stations are absolutely necessary for environmental loading reduction and quality assurance and safety. These precision measurements are difficult and stressful manual operations. Specifically, these measurements are done at high places, narrow places, uncomfortable environments, and so on. Therefore, workers in power stations are demanded stressful operations and painful postures among other things. Hence, we research and develop the precision geometrical measuring robot of crawler type enabled in surface roughness measurement to relieve stress and to improve working environment. To the best knowledge of authors, we do not know the research of robotization and self- propulsion for roughness measurement instruments. Conventionally, handling robots that supply workpieces to surface roughness measuring machines have been developed in the industry [1], however, this research is the first attempt on a self- propelled precision measuring robot [2]. In this research, we study and develop the crawler type precision measuring robot and the precision measurement unit using electromagnet for the purpose of precise measurement accuracy, light weight and small size. In the previous report, we presented a measurement experiment for the precision measuring robot. From the results of the measuring experiments, standard deviations of the roughness parameter value, Ra, were improved from one third to half by using the precision measuring robot [3]. Based on this experimental result, we consider that the use of the precision measurement unit using electromagnet results reduction of measurement variation. Example of factors of improved accuracy is vibration suppression, improved rigidity, resistance of temperature change, suppression of deformation, stability, and so on. In this paper, we focused on vibration and investigated and analyzed in which direction of X, Y, and Z the vibration suppression effect by the measuring unit with electromagnets was high using a small orthogonal three-axis accelerometer. The main conclusions in this study are as follows: 1. From the results of the vibration experiments, vibration in the X, Y, and Z directions was suppressed by using the measuring unit with electromagnets. 2. With regard to vibrations of the X and Y directions, significantly suppression of vibration peaks in the range of 400 Hz or less was revealed. 3. This study developed the measuring unit with electromagnets that the vibration in the Z direction can be damped approximately 10dB or more on average in the range of 400 Hz or less."
7,12,Mechanical properties of micro boron carbide samples simulating the fuel debris left in the Fukushima Daiichi power station ,"Mechanical properties of the fuel debris left in the Fukushima Daiichi power station is required to develop defueling machines and tools used in large-scale retrieval. The fuel debris has been first observed to be in some millimeter size and proved to be possibly sampled with a remote-controlled manipulator [1]. In this study, we aim to establish indentation method applied to the micro fuel debris samples. We examined how sample size and preparation process affect measurement of simulating boron carbide (B4C) particles sized up to 1000μm. While 1000μm particles well flattened with rough abrasive papers exhibit the mean elastic modulus and hardness which agree with those from a literature [2] at deviations of 1.6% and 9.5%, those values of 100μm particles are significantly lower even in the modulus at a deviation of 47%. The lower values of the 100μm particles are caused by inclined sample surface formed by insufficient flattening process. Once insufficiently polished 500μm particles were successfully flattened after the particles were embedded into resin by fixing with improving PVA films. The resultant mean modulus and hardness of the 500μm samples became near the referential values at the deviations of 4% and 8%."
7,9,Basic Study of Effects of Seawater upon Hydrogen Generated by Radiolysis of Water ,"Hydrogen is generated by radiolysis of water during the storage process of radioactivated inorganic absorbents and fuel debris in the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station. Radiolysis of water is caused by radiation from fission products and trans-uranium elements without high-temperature of several-hundred of degrees. Therefore,

In this study, hydrogen generation by radiolysis of water is investigated experimentally by irradiating X-ray to
pure H2O or H2O containing the seawater components as shown in Fig.2. As a result, more H2 was detected in the seawater sample as shown in Fig.3, and it was confirmed that H2 is hardly dissolved in water from the results of the conventional experiments.
  hydrogen continues to be generated the outside of the reactor or where those radioactive products exist
. Thus,
evaluation of the generation rate of hydrogen by radiolysis of water is important for a safe operation
In addition, in the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station accident, the phenomenon of hydrogen generation has become complicated by flowing seawater directly as a coolant for nuclear fuel in the reactor building. As shown in Fig.1, by radiolysis of water, radicals (e-aq, H, ・OH) and molecules (H2, H2O2, HO2) are produced as a primary product. On the other hand, in case of the radiolysis of seawater, oxidation of generated H2 is inhibited by the reaction betweenOH and seawater components like chloride and bromide ion, and then the amount of H2"

7,9,"Feasibility study of molding production of fuel pellets with used paper diaper, and practice based development of pellet molding machine ","As one of reuse method of used paper diaper, a combined reprocessing of used diaper is attractive for reducing disposal and converting it to a burning solid material. The used diaper has a high calorie density because fine powders of super absorbent polymer are embedded in the paper diaper, while that has a large amount of water content when being collected. A group, which one of the authors joined to, [1] had developed a thermal-mechanical rotary crusher which stripped the water contents and smashed collected mass of used diaper. This drier and crusher system supports to create a high calorie easy-burning materials and treat the diaper in a heat sterilization. This crushing power estimation is not yet analyzed due to its complexity. Nagasawa et al. [2] are studying this crushing mechanism from the similarity of crushing by a wedge indentation against the paperboard. Regarding the development of RPF (Refuse Paper and plastic Fuel) pellet, a mixing technique of the crushed diaper appears to be important. The making process of pellet is generally composed of 1) smashing and drying of used diapers; 2) cross slitting of long chips after smashing; 3) mixing and collecting into a sorting machine; and 4) molding of collected chips. Seeking the driving type of the rotary molding machine, the vertical axial structure is often known/produced in the Japanese market, but the horizontal axial structure seems to be not used. Therefore, in this work, a horizontal axial driving based molding machine has been developed by the aid of our integrated campus working group, Rokujikai. This research work aims to practically investigate the forming characteristics of crushed used diapers and/or artificially prepared virgin diapers. Since the used diaper, which is processed by the thermal- mechanical rotary crusher, is tends to be brittle and unwieldy, the authors focused on the forming/modeling of pellet, which is composed of smashed real-used diapers or artificially smashed virgin diapers. The developed RPF molding machine was composed of outside extrusion cylinder, which has many working holes, and inner eccentric- axial mechanism of pinion cylinder. Appropriately gathered volume (rough block) of smashed diapers is thrown into the entry window for moving into the minimum clearance zone which is made by the pinion and outside extrusion cylinder. The extrusion cylinder and the inner processing pinion cylinder bite and compress gathered working materials, and that are extruded through working holes in the radial direction. The outside extrusion cylinder is located in the horizontal direction and rotated by a driving motor via transmission belts. For utilizing the prototype molding machine, a certain large volume of used or virgin diapers are cut off and the appropriate volumes of them were wetted using a water spray device and then thrown into the entry window for making pellets. When continuing to rotate the extrusion cylinder under accumulating the volume of working materials (diapers) in the working space, the deformed and compressed pellets are drawn out from the working holes. In this work, the trace route of transferred working materials was experimentally investigated at the stationary rotated condition and analyzed the role of element parts for modifying the design layout and some parts were updated for reconfirming the processing performance. Finally, the outline and features of design principle of updated molding machine for making pellets was explained, using used and virgin smashed diapers."

In the future, investigate the unique peak of CTS by terahertz spectroscopy like CZTS. These materials are also proposed highly efficient and toxic-less solar cell material.
In this research, we investigated the crystal structure and its properties with a novel approach using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy for CZTS crystals. This materials are consisted by heavy atoms like Cu, they are considered to have some unique vibration in the THz band, and it is expected which crystal structure and physical properties are able to be obtained by measuring the THz absorption spectrum.

7,9,A Study of Control Method Having High Disturbance Suppression Performance for Downsizing Buck-type DC-DC Converter ,"Recently, the demand for an electric power converter is increasing for energy saving and protection of the environment, hence studies about downsizing of a DC-DC converter is hot topic. In general, the volume of a DC- DC converter depends on the volume of passive devices. Several circuit method and high-speed switching devices, such as GaN-HEMT for downsizing switching converters have been proposed. An example is a multi- phase method and this is especially effective. Moreover, inductor current and output voltage’s over/undershoot in transient of load current or input voltage should be considered. It requires the controller having high responsiveness by disturbance’s transient. Therefore, Power Balance Mode Control (PBMC) in Fig. 1 is proposed for boost-type DC-DC converter [1].
In this study, parameters in PBMC is adjusted to make optimal with buck-type DC-DC converter and this method is simulated by the circuit simulator, PSIM.

Due to a lack of farmland area, soil degradation and abnormal weather, the world will undergo serious food shortage. Now, we need to improve the crop efficiency. Our approach is as follows. 1) seed disinfection and 2) encouragement of seedling growth. Our idea is to accomplish these items by developing a comprehensive system of discharge plasma generator at atmospheric-pressure. The system has been designed to compensate all energy consumption with renewable energy. A pulsed high voltage with a high repetition rate was generated from battery-like low DC voltage by MOS-FET switching device controlled with Arduino and a transformer and was applied to a needle electrode. A pulsed discharge plasma was generated toward plant seeds for sterilization by reactive chemical species, such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals. The plasma was also generated toward water bulk to dissolve nitric acid, which is nutrient for plant. The system can produce a 250 ml solution with 45 ppm of nitric acid by 60 min-plasma treatment (Fig.1), which was sufficient for seedling growth improvement [1]. These results suggest that the system can contribute to crop improvement, even in the area where no or unstable electrical supply, such as developing countries. "
7,9,Investigate the influence of steam and high-dose-rate radiation on motor windings ,"1. Introduction
An investigation robot has been introduced in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant during
decommissioning work. Our study focuses on the effect of high temperature steam and high dose radiation on the motor windings used in investigation robot. To investigate the influence of radiation on motor winding, a radiation source that has high areal density of radiation is required. In this study, we use high-intensity pulsed radiation that generated by irradiating an electron beam to a metal target. Areal density of this pulsed radiation was measured by using a digital camera. A large number of white dots that considered the effect of radiation were existed in acquired images.
2. Method
The intense pulsed power generator named ETIGO-II was used for the electron beam generator. Pulsed
radiation was generated by irradiating an electron beam to 3 mm thickness of aluminum target. A digital camera was used for movie taking during the electron beam irradiation. The camera settings were 1280 x 720 pixels of image size and 25 fps of frame rate. The camera was placed at 2, 3 and 4 meter from the radiation source. One frame of image which exist a number of white dots was extracted from the taken movie. These white dots were counted by using image processing program.
3. Results
Figure 1 shows an acquired image that taken at 3 m from the radiation source. White dots were distributed
uniformly on the acquired image. Figure 2 shows the number of white dots at each distance from the radiation source. About 5600 of white dots were confirmed at the distance of 3 m. From this result, this radiation source can generate high areal density of radiation. Moreover, the number of white dots decreases as increase the distance from the radiation source. From this result, this radiation source was considered to be a point radiation source, and it had been possible to radiate spherically."
7,13,Effects of Sulfurization Process on Ag8SnS6 Thin Films ,"Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cell has achieved a conversion efficiency 22.9% [1]. However, CIGS thin film is composed of rare metal such as In and Ga which increase production cost. Thus, it is not easy for CIGS solar cell to meet high demand of PV market. For searching new materials, we are focusing on Ag8SnS6 which consists non-toxic and low-cost materials. Ag8SnS6 has a band-gap energy of 1.33 eV and a high light absorption coefficient of 104cm-1 [2], and therefore Ag8SnS6 solar cells can be expected to have high conversion efficiency. Ag8SnS6 thin films were fabricated by sulfurization of Ag/SnS/glass stacked precursors deposited by a vacuum evaporation. Sulfurization was performed by either one-stage (500 °C for 1 hour), two-stage (160 °C 30 min. + 560 °C 30 min.) or three-stage (160 °C 30 min. + 450 °C 30 min. + 560 °C 30 min.) sulfurization processes in H2S atmosphere.From X-ray patterns and Raman spectra, the peaks attributed to
   orthorhombic Ag8SnS6 crystal were observed in all samples. The intensity of these peaks of Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns became stronger by using two- and three-stage sulfurization process. Figure 1 shows SEM images of different sulfurization process. From SEM images, the thin films prepared by three-stage sulfurization resulted in the largest grain size of 2.5 μm and a dense and smooth surface. The absorption coefficients and the band-gap energy of Ag8SnS6 thin films were above 104 cm-1 and 1.30-1.34 eV, respectively. We succeeded in obtaining high quality Ag8SnS6 thin films using three-stage sulfurization process."
7,13,Effect of lignin addition and scanning range on Cyclic Voltammetry ,"1. Introduction
Lead acid battery is secondary battery used as large capacity battery but it has the disadvantage of slow
charging speed. Lignin is added in the negative electrode. It has many effects on charge / discharge performance. The addition of lignin improves the discharge performance but further degrades the charge performance. Therefore, it is difficult to use in an environment which charging and discharging do frequently. If the defect is improved, it can also be used as a battery for solar power storage system and idling stop cars. However, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of lignin on charge / discharge reaction by real battery. Therefore, evaluation method isn’t established. This is because the effects of various manufacturing processes are complicatedly involved. This research aimed to evaluate of lignin addition on charge / discharge reaction by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and FIB-SEM.
   The conventional CV measures 200cycles of scanning range -0.6V to -1.5V, and the result is shown in Fig.1. When lignin was added, the amount of charge was larger than when it was not added. It was different from the tendency that the charge performance was deteriorated by addition of lignin in real battery. The reason is that the scanning range of the sweep is wide and charging is repeated after complete discharge, and such operation is not performed when using the battery. Therefore, it is considered that the performance of the real battery could not be evaluated. Therefore, to approximate use of real battery, the folding potential of anode sweep was reduced, and the effect of lignin on CV shape was evaluated.

 2. Experimental method
CV measurement is three electrodes method. The working and counter electrode are Pb plate, reference
electrode is Hg/Hg2SO4. 50mL sulfuric acid was used as electrolyte. Initial charging was performed at -1.2V for 40 minutes, and 0.5mL of lignin aqueous was added at 20 minutes of initial charging. After the CV measurement, observed cross sectional near the surface of working electrode by FIB-SEM.
3. Result
The result is shown in Fig.2. It can be seen that when lignin was added, the cathode reduction peak
became broad. The maximum current density of the cathode reduction peak when lignin was added was -0.961Am-
2 -2
, while it was -6.03Am without addition. It was observed that the charging rate was reduced by the addition of
lignin. Therefore, it can be seen that charging speed is slow by addition of lignin. It was possible to confirm the nature that lignin deteriorates the charge performance if it is set to scan range that does not completely discharge. When lignin was added, lead sulfate was thicker than when no lignin was added. Lead sulfate thickness corresponds charge."
7,9,Effects of Al/Ni Ratio on Exothermic Heat of Cold-Rolled Al/Ni Multilayer Material,"It is well-known that Al/Ni multilayer materials, which can generate large amount of heat instantaneously during transformation to Al-Ni intermetallic compounds, have lots of technical advantages when used as a heat source. The exothermic heat depends on the composition of Al and Ni (at%). For using as a heat source application, the exothermic heat must be optimised to avoid over or under heating. In previous study, differences of the maximum exothermic temperature by each Al:Ni ratio have confirmed. To composition of Al and Ni, X-ray crystal structure analysis by general benchtop X-ray diffraction system was conducted, and the crystal structures were revealed roughly. However, the non-random orientation of the powder material and wide range of particle size distribution (approximately 75-250um) make the precise crystallography by the benchtop X-ray diffraction system difficult. To obtain more accurate crystallographic information, these two problems are to be avoided. Compared to benchtop analysis setup, synchrotron has many advantages as the X-ray source, for example, high energy and short wavelength are the representative. These benefits enable experiment by transmission geometry and to get more precise crystallographic information. Therefore, precise X-ray diffraction crystallography using synchrotron X-ray source was carried out for the determination of the crystal structure of reacted Al/Ni multilayer materials. Experiment setup is shown in figurel. As the result shown in figure2 (b), (c), (d), slightly different amount of unreacted Al and Ni or Al/Ni intermetallic compound between 40pass and 60pass is found. Further studies are needed in order to determine the composition of reacted Al/Ni multilayer material."

7,3,Electrochemical Polymerization of Aniline in A Polystyrene Sulfonate Solution and Characterization of the Resulting Film ,"Introduction
Polyaniline (PANI) is a promising material in manufacturing biosensors and biofuel cells because of its low production cost, relatively high conductivity and interesting redox properties. In general, PANI shows electroactivity only under acidic conditions due to its redox property associated with protonation of the nitrogen atoms in the polymer backbone. A strategy in which the electroactivity of PANI can be extended to neutral conditions is to synthesize the polymer in the presence of anionic polyelectrolyte with a sulfonate group. In present work, PANI was prepared in the form of film by electrochemical polymerization of aniline in a polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) aqueous solution and characterization of the resulting film (PANI/PSS film) was performed under a neutral condition.
Experimental
The polymerization was carried out with a conventional three-electrode cell. A gold film deposited on an alumina plate, a platinum plate and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as a working electrode, a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. The polymerization was conducted by applying a constant potential of 0.75 V vs. SCE to the working electrode in a 0.3 M aniline aqueous solution including 18 wt% PSS.
  Electrochemical properties of the PANI/PSS film were examined by cyclic voltammetry. carried out at 25 °C in a phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.0)

Results and discussion
In advance, a suitable potential for the polymerization was determined by linear sweep voltammetry. As a result, it was found that the PANI/PSS film was obtained at a potential above 0.70 V vs. SCE. In the present work, a relatively low potential (0.75 V vs. SCE) was selected in order to avoid overoxidation of PANI. The resulting PANI/PSS film gave definite peaks reflecting the redox process of PANI (Fig. 1). This result suggests that the PANI/PSS film has electroactivity under neutral conditions. The intensity of the redox peaks was hardly decreased by successive potential scans and, therefore, the elimination of PSS from the PANI/PSS film was considered to be neglected."

tetravalent cerium ion is [Xe]4f 5d , making it a candidate for use as an efficient photocatalyst. In this study, the
synthesis, the crystal structure determination and photocatalytic properties of the perovskite oxides BaCeO3 and the solid solutions BaCe0.95R0.05O3 (R = La, Pr and Gd) were investigated.
Perovskite-type oxides containing lanthanides BaCeO3 and BaCe0.95R0.05O3 (R = La, Pr and Gd) were synthesized by pechini method (Fig.1). BaCeO3 mainly absorbed ultraviolet light, while all of BaCe0.95R0.05O3 absorbed visible-light. All of BaCe0.95R0.05O3 showed higher photocatalytic activity than BaCeO3 under visible- light irradiation (Fig.2). Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue has been investigated in aqueous suspension under artificial sunlight irradiation for the evaluation of these photocatalysts (Fig.3). It was found that perovskite- type oxides containing rare earths BaCe0.95R0.05O3 drive as visible-light responsive photocatalysts. This suggests that the band gap of the photocatalyst can be freely controlled by inserting the 4f orbital of the lanthanide ions."
7,9,Electrophoresis of Nanocarbon Particles with Metal@multilayered Graphene Structure ,"In recent years, nanocarbon has attracted attention as an electrode material. In current reports, some nonplatinum-group metal catalysts composed of N, Fe, and C show remarkable initial-stage performance in a single cell. In particular, graphene has received broad attention. For example, vertically aligned nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes, reduced graphene oxide/platinum supported electrocatalysts (RGO/Pt), nitrogen-containing graphene sheets (N-graphene), stabilizing metal catalysts at metal–metal oxide-graphene triple junctions (Pt–ITO-graphene), graphene-wrapped multiwalled carbon nanotubes, and nitrogen-doped graphene nanoplatelets (N-GNP) have been reported.
Microwave-assisted synthesis and microwave-assisted catalytic decomposition have attracted attention as innovative green technology. Here, we have synthesized a new nanocarbon from methane by microwave-assisted catalytic decomposition [1,2]. This nanocarbon has the structure of a multilayered graphene nanoshell (metal@multilayered graphene). As shown in Eq.

In recent research, synthesized nanocarbon is considered to have some physical properties. However, separation of nanocarbon is difficult. Therefore, the separation effect on the synthesized nanocarbon was examined, focusing on the electrophoresis method. As a result, we have obtained factors that impact the effectiveness of existing separation methods."
7,9,Examination of a Chlorine-based Electrolysis System for the Production of Valuable Chemicals ,"The sea, which accounts for 70% of the earth's surface, contains salt at a concentration of about 3%. Its component, chlorine, is used in many fields and is an indispensable resource for mankind. However, it raises concerns regarding its environmental impact, such as the development of hazardous chlorine by-products. Therefore, the effective use of chlorine is an important issue for humanity and requires a new approach that takes into account its environmental risks.
Chlorine is extracted as chlorine gas by electrolysis of saline solution. In general, electrolysis uses electrical energy to chemically change a substance to a state with a high chemical potential. Therefore, it corresponds to the reverse reaction of a battery, and makes it theoretically possible to extract energy from the generated chlorine gas.
The field of chlorine energy conversion has been investigated for a long time. For example, in Japan, a zinc-chlorine battery was examined as part of a project under the Moonlight Project by the New Energy Development Organization. However, the obtained results were not promising. In recent years, efforts to create a hydrogen energy conversion society have accelerated, and fuel cells, which are key devices for this process, have attracted more attention. Similarly, chlorine energy conversion using a fuel cell would be theoretically possible, but few relevant reports have been published till today.

7,8,Fabrication of Cu3VO4 thin films by Mist CVD method ,"1. Introduction
The oxide semiconductors possessing cubic diamond-like structure have been limited to Cu3VO4 except for
Cu3ReO4, in contrast to chalcogenide which involved Cu(I) such as CuInS2, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu3AsS4 adopt easily cubic diamond-like structure. Recently, it has been reported that Cu3VO4 has narrow band gap of 1.2 eV and Cu3- xVO4 films exhibits p-type semiconductor. It indicated that Cu3VO4 is a candidate material for photoelectric conversion materials. In this research, we fabricated a Cu3VO4 thin film by mist chemical vapor deposition (mist CVD) method which allows the formation of high quality films in atmosphere without using vacuum equipment. 2. Experimental methods
Cu3VO4 thin film was grown on non-alkali glass by hot wall Mist-CVD. Cupper (II) acetate monohydrate and bis (2, 4-pentanedionate) - Vanadium (IV) oxide were used as precursors, which were diluted in methanol. A few drops of hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added in solution to prevent any precipitation. The precursor in the solution is ultrasonically atomized into the mist form and the precursor mist was transported into a heated furnace with nitrogen gas fed through the carrier and dilution lines. The growth time was a constant of 40 min.
3. Result and discussion
Fig.1 shows the XRD pattern of film grown on
non-alkali glass at 500°C. The diffractions observed at 2 = 34°and 2 = 39°could be indexed by Cu3VO4. However, the diffraction of metal Cu was observed at 2 = 43 ̊ in addition to Cu3VO4. A pure- phase Cu3VO4 films have not been obtained yet. We plan to study the optimal synthesis conditions for obtaining a single phase of Cu3VO4 by changing the reaction temperature, flow rate, and precursor materials."
7,13,Preparation of Thermoelectric Materials with Carbon Nanotubes,"Thermoelectric materials directly generate electricity from heat through the Seebeck effect. This system has received much attention in recent years as a power generation system that does not generate carbon dioxide. Bismuth-tellurium, lead-tellurium, and silicon-germanium are typical thermoelectric materials, but they are fragile and have high specific gravity. Furthermore, some elements in these thermoelectric materials are toxic.
We have focused on carbon nanotubes as one of alternative materials. Carbon nanotubes(CNTs) contain iron nanoparticles inside the nanotubes because CNTs were prepared by rapid pyrolysis of a mixture of ferrocene and hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane and hexane. As a result, a positive correlation between the amount of iron particles included in CNTs and the Seebeck coefficients showed that the large contacting area between metal and CNTs is much important. Cosequently, composite materials consisting of metal and CNTs have been prepared for improvement of Seebeck coefficient.
In this presentation, we will report on the carbon nanotube-based thermoelectric materials."
7,12,A Novel Fuel Cell Driven by A Microbial Metabolite of Lignin-Derived Aromatic Compounds ,"Introduction
In producing biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass, lignin is an obstacle due to its complex structure. However, the total energy stored in chemical bonds of lignin should not be ignored for achieving sustainable growth. Thus, it is necessary to develop technologies to utilize effectively the energy stored in lignin. In this study, we propose a novel system combining microbial production of gallic acid, an excellent reducing agent, from lignin-derived aromatic compounds and electrochemical oxidation of the resulting gallic acid (Fig. 1). This system can be applied to fuel cells to directly produce electricity from lignocellulosic biomass.
Experimental
Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 was selected as a microbial catalyst for the production of gallic acid. The microbial production of gallic acid was carried out using syringate as a model lignin-derived compound. Resting cells of SYK-6 prepared from cells cultured in lysogeny broth at 30 °C were incubated with 1.0 mM syringate. The formation of gallic acid was monitored by a colorimetric assay using ferricyanide ion.
Results and discussion
The colorimetric assay showed that gallic acid was generated from syringate by metabolic reactions of SYK-6, suggesting that the system proposed in this study is feasible. However, the resulting gallic acid was partially degraded by SYK-6 cells at the same time. In order to improve the yield of gallic acid, we are investigating the ability of SYK-6 mutants, which lack the ring-cleavage dioxygenase genes involved in the degradation of gallic acid."
7,13,Cloning of lipid metabolism-related genes in lipid-producing microalgae ,"In recent years, lipid-producing microalgae attract attention as one of the solutions to the serious environmental problems caused by global warming. Since microalgae grow fast and do not compete with food production, biodiesel derived from microalgae is expected to replace fossil fuels in the future. However, biodiesel from microalgae has some disadvantages such as contamination by bacteria or other microalgae and the energy cost of purification. Therefore, further study in the development of genetic engineering technology will benefit the production of biodiesel from microalgae.
A new strain of lipid-producing microalgae named β1 was used in this study. It was collected at Kashiko swamp in Iwaki City, Fukushima Prefecture. It was confirmed that β1 produces and accumulates lipids and grows under acidic conditions. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that it is Coccomyxa genus that mainly lives in the polar regions.
DGAT is a major lipid metabolism-related gene in the TAG synthesis pathway. It is involved in the rate-limiting step of the TAG synthesis pathway. Since algae of the genus Coccomyxa mainly produce TAG, we did cloning the cDNA encoding DGAT from β1. Goal is cloning a full-length cDNA encoding DGAT that is lipid metabolism related gene.
Total RNA was extracted from β1 grown on AF6 medium agar plates (pH4) using RNAiso plus reagent (Takara Bio). The cDNA was prepared using total RNA as template, oligo(dT) primer, and PrimeScript II cDNA synthesis Kit (Takara Bio). PCR was performed with the primers designed based on the DGAT cDNA of Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169 that is related species of β1. PCR products extracted from gels and purified were used for sequencing.
We determined 1407 bp and 469 amino acids in the range of exon1 to exon7. The cDNA cloning using the 3'RACE and 5'RACE methods with reference to the Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169 DGAT gene would be performed to determine the entire nucleotide sequence and analyze the active site."
7,12,Electrode surface of lead acid battery under the dilute sulfuric acid ,"Lead acid battery (LAB) is the most famous secondary battery applied for various purposes such as engine startup system, industrial backup system, renewable energy sources storage devices and so on. The advantages of LAB are as follows: a wide range of electric discharge- ability, superb economic efficiency, stability under the various environmental and high reusability. The problem in LAB is so-called sulfation of negative electrode as illustrated in Fig.1. Sulfation degrades the performance of charge acceptance. Lignosulfonate (LS) polymer is commonly used as an additive for desulfation (anti-shrinkage agent). It is important to understand the authentic electro-chemical (EC) reaction of LS inside LAB [1]. Simultaneous atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements provide the information of surface structure during electro chemical reaction . In recent years, technology related to AFM has made rapid progress, frequency modulation mode AFM (FM-AFM) [2] has also been developed, which is suitable to observe liquid-solid interface and may provide us a force mapping throughout the electrolyte (dilute sulfuric acid) layer in a vicinity of negative electrode.
In this study, in-situ FM-AFM combining with the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement will be carried out to observe the electrochemical reaction of lead electrode (Pb + SO42- ⇔ PbSO4 + 2e−)."
7,9,Hybrid optical wireless power transmission with 3-terminal tandem photovoltaic cell ,"In recent years, technologies related to wireless power transmission, such as radio frequency identifier and charging facilities for electric vehicles, have attracted attention. Wireless power transmission has various types of energy transmission methods such as electromagnetic induction, magnetic field resonance, microwave, and laser. In particular, wireless power transmission using laser light has the following three characteristics. 1.The beam divergence angle is small, it is easy to transmit energy over long distances. 2.The range irradiated with the beam is narrow, information leakage can be suppressed. 3. Miniaturization of equipment due to the absence of wiring. These features are being investigated by various organizations for use in drones and space probes.
In this study, we propose a wireless laser power transmission system with two-way communication function using a 3-terminal tandem photovoltaic cell as a light receiving element. As a result, the communication system and the power feeding system can be integrated, and a reduction in size and weight of the system is expected. A tandem photovoltaic cell has a structure in which a plurality of cells having different band gaps are joined in series and can convert light in a wider wavelength range than a single photovoltaic cell, resulting in a highly efficient photovoltaic cell. Moreover, the top cell and the bottom cell can be operated separately by using a 3-terminal connection as shown in Fig.1 for the terminal structure of the tandem photovoltaic cell. If this feature is used, information can be transmitted by applying voltage to the top cell and generating EL, and wireless power transmission and signal reception can be performed by irradiating the bottom cell with a laser. The photovoltaic cell joining method used here was smart stack technology developed at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. This is a bonding method using palladium nanoparticles for bonding between cells, and has low electrical and optical loss, and cells that cannot be bonded by crystal growth due to a difference in lattice constant can be bonded. The photovoltaic cell joining method used here was smart stack technology developed at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. In this paper, we report on the simultaneous use of EL and laser power using GaAs // InGaAsP three-terminal smart- stack multi-junction solar cells, which were verified by LTspice simulations and experiments."
7,13," Adsorption Behavior of Trivalent Actinides and Lanthanides on Pyridine
 ","Treatment and disposal of radioactive waste are one of most important issues for sustainable usage of nuclear energy. Removal of actinides from high level radioactive waste becomes important in waste management. However, trivalent actinides (An(III)) and lanthanides (Ln) are difficult to be separated because both have similar ion radii. Thus, simple and efficient separation of An(III) from Ln process has been required.
We have been studied the separation of An(III) by using pyridine resin. The pyridine has the two functions; i.e., weakly basic anion exchanger and soft donor legend. In previous studies, we have been studied about the group separation of An (III) and Ln in HCL system [1]. Complete separation of Am and Cm was achieved by using methanolic nitric solution [2]. Adsorption behaviors of An(III) and Ln in HCl system and HNO3 system are completely different. Adsorption mechanism of An(III) and Ln in HNO3 system is ion exchange while in HCl system, adsorption mechanism of An(III) is coordination [3]. The adsorption mechanism of Ln in HCl system was inferred to be ion exchange from comparison with HNO3 system and LiCl aqueous solution system [4].
In the present study, we investigated the absorption behavior of

was used as An(III). Stable Eu with 152Eu, and stable Nd were used as Ln. This experiment was carried out by chromatography, and the Am, Eu and Nd were detected by ICP-MS and -ray spectrometry. The pH was adjusted to 11 for the suppress the protonation with pyridine group, because the pyridine has a function of ion exchange only if protonation occurred. The obtained chromatogram was shown in Fig. This figure show that the Am is most strongly adsorbed among these elements. This fact means the adsorption strength don’t obey the ionic radii. i.e, this difference of adsorption is not due to the function of ion exchange but soft donor legand of pyridine.
This work was partially performed under the Inter-University Cooperative Research Program of the Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University (Proposal No. 17F0018), and under the long training course of “Education Program on Separation & Analysis for Radioactive Waste Disposal (head: Tohoku University)” in Global Nuclear Human Resource Development Program Grant from MEXT.

7,13,Basic Study on Thermochemical Conversion of Hardly Dissolved Substances Including Uranium Oxides for Chemical Analysis ,"The analysis of actinides in nuclear spent fuels or nuclear debris are important for actinide management, i.e., the decision of how to deal with actinides in these materials. Before almost any analysis, the dissolution of these substances into solution is necessary for precise and accuracy analysis, and the nuclide separations and actinide separation as pretreatment of analyses. The substances including uranium oxides, e.g., nuclear spent fuels and debris, are not easy to be dissolved into acidic solution. We have proposed that these substitutes are chemically converted into easily soluble substitutes by thermochemical reactions.
In the present work, the basic study on the chlorination process was carried out. The hardly soluble substitutes packed in a Swagelok capsule made by 316ss with CCl4 was heated. At first, CeO2 powder was used as a simulated material of uranium oxide compounds. The chlorination experiments were at 300°C, molar ratio (CCl4:CeO2=1.2,1.5,3,5,8) and heating time (1h,2h and 4h only for ratio at 8), the products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction apparatus (XRD), and it was confirmed that chloride was formed at a molar ratio of 8, heating for 4 hours. The feasibility of using this system for chlorination experiments was confirmed.The chlorination experiment was also carried out using U3O8 powder and CCl4 at 300 °C, and the molar ratio (U3O8:CCl4) was 19 and 23, heating for 4h. Both has similar phenomenon,as shown in Fig.1,the black U3O8 powder turns into strongly deliquescent yellowish-green powder, and brown impurities may have been produced by corrosion.XRD analysis of the product confirmed the formation of U chloride such as UCCl4 and the residual of U3O8 powder."
7,13,Engineering Study on Lithium Isotope Separation by Ion Exchange Chromatography ,"Nuclear fusion is one of the answers for the sustainable clean energy supply and the countermeasure against climate change. However, there are many hurdles to overcome for engineering application. The supply of fusion fuel is one of issues, because the tritium as fusion fuel need to be made by 6Li(n,)T. and 6Li enrichment is necessary. The engineeringly established lithium isotope separation is currently only amalgam method. However, since the mercury is toxic material, other environmental acceptable methods are required. We have been proposing the lithium isotope separation method by the ion exchange.
In the preent study, we performed separation experiments by chromatography with a length of 4 m at a high flow rate of 10 m/day using the high porous cation exchange resin, MP-50, Dow Chemical. The picture of experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. The lithium acetate aqueous solution was fed into column packed with proton-type cation exchange resin. The lithium ion was exchanged for potassium ion by feed of potassium acetate aqueous solution. We confirmed that the band interface can be checked by UV light, as shown in Fig. 2. The lithium fractionation was confirmed as shown in Fig. 3. 6Li was enriched from 7.5% to 8.3%.
We also studied the detection methods by use of varying electric conductivity or pH. The electric conductivity is available for both frontend and backend. pH method is available for frontend, but the varying of pH in backend is too small to determine the backend interface."

7,9,FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF TRICHODERMAPEPSIN MOTER IN Trichoderma reesei,"Trichoderma reesei is an exploited filamentous fungus in enzyme industry. Its secretome contains a mixture of cellulases, hemicellulases, amylases, proteases, and lipases that synergistically degrade plant biomass. With the developments of industrial biotechnology, genetically engineered stains produced more extracellular proteins and widely used in the pulp and paper and biofuel industries. As a model organism its enzyme secretion mechanisms have been investigating in protein and gene levels. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of main protease Trichodermapepsin (TrAsP), production mechanism and its transcriptional regulation.
First, we analyzed the role of main protease and its production mechanism using deletion strain of the parent strain QM9414 [1]. Cellulase activity and Saccharification rate of cellulosic biomass were measured. Higher activities of CMCase, Avicelase, and Xylanase in QM∆trasp were measured compared to that of QM9414. Saccharification rate of cellulosic biomass also increased the effect was not significant due to the absence of difference in BGL activity compared to QM9414. Further carbon and nitrogen responsive trasp production mechanism was observed.
Secondly, we focused analysis of the functional region of trasp. Known binding motifs of cis element regulators; Xyr1 (main activator of cellulase expression), Cre1 (Carbon catbolite repressor, AreA (Global nitrogen regulator), Pac1(Global pH regulator) and Xpp1 (Repressor for hemicallulase expression) were identified in exist in Promoter region (Fig.1). Protease activity and real time qRT-PCR were carried out using gene deletion stains of above regulators. Xyr1 and Are1 acted as trasp repressor and activator respectively. Further, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and site mutagenesis of particular binding motifs confirmed the functionality of Xyr1 and Are1 transcription factors for trasp regulation. In addition, promoter deletant analysis suggested new trasp regulators exist in cis region of trasp. These results improve the knowledge of known cis regulators of T. reesei and contribute for enzyme industry."
7,14,Characteristics of methanotrophic microbial community structure at the seafloor surface of the Nankai Trough ,"Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene and methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene on the seafloor surface of the Nankai Trough was conducted. DNA was extracted from a total of 14 samples (2 samples from methane seep area and 12 samples from general seafloor areas).
As a result of the phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene, one clone was found to have 96% homology with the 16S rRNA gene sequence of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum, a halophilic methane-oxidizing bacterium, in a sample taken from the methane seep area. However, overall, no characteristic pattern was observed in the bacterial community structure between the methane seep area and the general seafloor. In contrast, in archaea, the genus Methanosarcina was predominantly detected in the samples from the methane seep area. Among them, many sequences that were closely related to anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea, which perform anaerobic methane oxidation, were detected.
On the other hand, pmoA gene fragments were detected from methane seep sample by using two different primer pairs whereas from general samples only detected using primer pair of A189-mb661. On the quantitative PCR results, the methane seep sample have 106 copies per g-sediment of pmoA gene on the other hand general seafloor area of Nankai Trough contains 103 – 104 copies per g-sediment of pmoA gene. Phylogenetic analysis of pmoA gene sequences showed that quite different sequences were detected between general and methane seep area. Especially, the primers of pmof1 and pmor detected pmoA genes specific for methane seep area. The results obtained this study could be useful for detection of unintended leakage of methane in the methane hydrate production site."
8,9,Feasibility study of wear measurement method by interference fringe analysis for female taper surface of machine tool ,"Machine tool maintenance is automated at the production site in recent years. However, maintenance of female taper wear of machine tool is still used to sensory inspection. Sensory inspection is the standard in also the industrial standard [1]. This maintenance method for female taper of machine tool depends on the skill of craftsman and requires a lot of time. Furthermore, this maintenance method hinders automation advancement and productivity improvement. Therefore, in this study, we aim to establish a measurement method independent of skill and sense of craftsman. In this paper, the wear of female taper is measured by interference fringes. Interference fringes are generated by shearing interferometry, because no reference plane require [2,3]. Worn Shape of female taper of machine tool is obtained by interference fringes analysis with Fourier transform and then quantitative measurement is performed by comparing the worn shape with the original shape. The establishing of the proposed wear measurement method and system of this study is considered to achieve automatization and digitization of the maintenance for female taper of machine tool.

Therefore, CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) and Al alloy has been applied to automotive structures instead of steels. However, it is difficult to joint these materials because of differences of material properties. From this reason, adhesive bonding or mechanical fastening has been widely used in dissimilar material joining.It is well known that strength and stiffness of CFRP can be control with change in carbon laminate structures. In addition, strength of adhesive lap joint is effected by differences of jointed materials stiffness. In this study, as a purpose of optimization of carbon laminate structures of CFRP in case of dissimilar joining, influence of laminate structures on strength of CFRP/Al alloy adhesive bonded joint was investigated.

9,8,Strength Evaluation Method of Piezoelectric Materials by Use of Similarity of Elastic Analysis Theory ,"Piezoelectric materials have become an important branch of modern engineering materials with the recent development of the intelligent materials and structures. So there has been considerable research on the stress concentration and singularity for piezoelectric materials by using theoretical and numerically analysis method [1] [2]. But by the difficulty of measurement method and specimen creation, its experimental studies have not yet been conducted so much. For determination of fracture mechanics parameters, the establishment of experimental evaluation method of mechanical and electric fields in piezoelectric materials is required. So we focused on the similarity of analysis theory between piezoelectric materials and elastic materials.
In this research, clarifications of similarity of analysis theory for piezoelectric materials polarized in each direction are performed. Furthermore, the estimation methods of strain field in piezoelectric materials are proposed by use of similarity.
Analysis theory for piezoelectric material polarized in the thickness direction is similar to that of torsion problem for isotropic materials. Governing equations are given as follows:
22
 U  0,   0 for piezoelectric materials
2  0 for isotropic materials of torsion problem
On the other hands, analysis theory for piezoelectric material polarized in the plane direction is similar to that
of anisotropic materials. Governing equations are given as follows: (L L  L 2 )U  0 for piezoelectric materials
   423 2
(L4L2 L3)F0 foranisotropicmaterials
And we propose the estimation method of strain  p in piezoelectric materials as follows:

9,7,Characteristics of Hydrogen-Carbon Dioxide Jet Diffusion Flames on Slit Burner ,"In recent years, global warming has become one of severe problems in the world. This problem is mainly caused by emissions of carbon dioxide. Thus, the use of hydrogen has increased in order to realize the low carbon society, and then hydrogen storage tanks have become widespread. Now, carbon dioxide, an inexpensive inert gas, is added to hydrogen to suppress explosion. In order to use hydrogen safely, it is necessary to investigate the behavior and structure of jet flames caused by mixture leak from the crack of hydrogen storage tanks. We need to elucidate the characteristics of hydrogen-carbon dioxide jet diffusion flames.
In this paper, we observed experimentally the structure and behavior of hydrogen-carbon dioxide jet diffusion flames on slit burner and investigated the effects of flow rate of mixture and hydrogen concentration. The slit burner port is 1 × 60 mm. The flow rates of hydrogen-carbon dioxide mixture Q are 0.10–5.00 L/min, the average flow velocities V are 0.03–1.39 m/s and the hydrogen concentration of the mixture is up to 70%. We took direct photographs using a digital camera to obtain the size of separate flamelets, flame height and flame width on slit burner.
The flammable range of the hydrogen concentration widened as the flow rate of hydrogen-carbon dioxide mixture increased. The flame height increased as the flow rate of hydrogen-carbon dioxide mixture increased. This was because the flame height increased with the flow rate in laminar diffusion combustion."
9,12,Evaluation of Shape Accuracy and Strength of MAX phase Ceramic Female Thread Machined by Lathe,"Screws are used in various fields so that there is no machine that does not use screws, but screw seizure and
deformation are likely to occur in fastening of casting equipment, industrial furnaces, burners, etc. Although it is
[1] sufficient to use ceramic screws with high heat resistance. The authors have studied thread processing , but
ceramics have high hardness and low toughness, so threading with existing taps is difficult.
In this study, the processing and tightening characteristics of MAX phase ceramic female threads are evaluated. Internal threading is performed on the material of the MAX phase ceramics with a tap attached to the lathe, and then the thread is processed(Fig.1), so the strength of the screw is evaluated using a compression load tester(Fig.2). Furthermore, the shape of the threaded part and the surface roughness of the cut surface of the MAX phase ceramic female thread are measured using a laser microscope. The excellent shape accuracy of the MAX phase
ceramic female thread will appeal to the potential of ceramics, which has previously been difficult to machine. Since parts can be manufactured using existing processing resources, screws of MAX phase ceramics can be used with small capital investment even in small and medium-sized enterprises. Taking advantage of this feature,
 MAX phase ceramic screws are expected to be commercialized in cooperation with companies."
9,12,Wedge cutting characteristics of copper foil stacked on adhesive tape ,"A wedge indentation processing is widely used for cutting off a sheet material into a complicated formed pattern such as carton boxes, labels, insulation films and similar metal thin sheets. When wedge cutting in laminated structure, there may occur trouble due to air inflow, the peeling of the cut end-surface and separation of flow and cut end-surfaces of the glue. But the trouble has not been clarified sufficiently. The measures taken by experience knowledge of the operator. Processing conditions of wedge cutting to evaluate the effect of the cutting properties of the laminated structure, it is necessary to clarify the proper cutting conditions. Therefore, in this study, effect of cutting speed and the included angle in cutting of the structure on the processing characteristics, for the roughness of the cut and the cutting shape with a wedge blade, was analyzed experimentally. By under various conditions, and subjected to observation of the test piece cut end surface and the cutting test, the maximum cutting force and the warp angle measurement of the cut section, it was confirmed that the included angle and the cutting speed affects the cutting processing characteristics"
9,11,"Device Development for Stress Control
Using Piezoelectric Actuator and Verification Experiment","It is important to control the growth of fatigue cracks for a long time. These cracks usually occur from the stress concentration at the corner and the heat stress area by the welding heat and so on. And these are growing due to the vibration. When a crack length reaches the limit, it is called an unstable fracture state. Then, it cannot be controlled.
The aims of this study are to relax the stress of stress concentrated part and to suppression crack growth. By using the piezoelectric actuator as a method of suppressing crack growth, we could perform relaxation in the stress of stress concentrated part. However, if the piezoelectric actuator adhered to the test piece directly, a problem arises. As problems, the amount of deformation escapes to the outside, or repeating attachment and detachment damages the piezoelectric actuator. We need method of locally and efficiently compressing the stress concentration part. We also need how to detachable. Therefore, we developed the device of compressive stress field that is easy to set. By using this device, we can take compression locally and simply. We will confirm prolonging life of the material by performing fatigue test, using this device (Fig. 1)."
9,7,Absorption properties of Cu2O nanosphere solutions for microfabrication of Cu-based microstructures by green femtosecond laser pulses ,"Three-dimensional microfabrication using femtosecond (fs) laser pulse-induced multi-photon absorption is promising for direct writing of polymer and metal microstructures. To date, Au and Ag microstructures have been
[1]
Cu2O NS solution were synthesized by polyol method. The solution was spin-coated on glass substrate and baked. Direct writing using green femtosecond laser pulses was performed in air. Wavelength, pulse duration, and repetition rate of the laser were 515 nm, 100 fs, and 40 MHz, respectively. The laser pulses were focused onto the samples using an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.90.
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show single- and multi- photon absorption properties. Although the absorption at the wavelength of fs laser pulses (515 nm) was small, an intense absorption was exhibited at the half of the wavelength. In addition, the transmittance at around z = 0 was low in z-scan method. These results indicate that two-photon absorption was dominant. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show AFM images of the microstructures fabricated at the focal spot of z=-2.5 and -3.0 respectively. The height of the micropatterns depended on the focal spot as shown in Fig. 2(c). These results suggest that the microstructures were directly formed inside the Cu2O NS solution film using two-photon absorption.

First, absorption properties of Cu2O NS solution were evaluated at green fs laser wavelength. Then, 3D microfabrication was performed."
9,7,"Edge Detection of Magnetic Domain Images Obtained by a Magneto-optical Kerr Effect
 Microscopy with Au Plasmon Filters","Nd-Fe-B magnets have attracted attention to be used for traction motors. However, the coercive force of the magnet significantly decreases at high temperature. Coercive forces of the magnetic materials depend on the microstructures which are composed of the materials. Therefore, observation of the magnetic domains is important. To date, we have achieved high-contrast and high-resolution imaging of the magnetic domains of Nd-Fe-B by a magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy using Au plasmon filters [1]. However, the detection of the magnetic domains was manually operated. In this study, we obtained the images of magnetic domains and automatically detected of their edges to apply this system to in-Situ observation.
Figures 1 show a magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and an Au plasmon filter. In the microscopy, lineally polarized incident light was irradiated to the surface of the magnet which was covered by the Au plasmon filter. As a result, high contrast images were obtained by increasing of the magneto-optical Kerr effect. The images of fine magnetic domains were also cleared, resulting that high resolution imaging was achieved. The Au plasmon filter was fabricated by Au thin film deposition on SiO2 glass substrates, following the heating at 350 °C for 1 hour in air. Au nanoparticles were self-organized on the substrate.
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show an obtained image and (b)the image with edges of magnetic domains which were automatically detected, respectively. First, a brightness distribution of the original image was obtained. The two peaks were determined as black and white. When the brightness differences between the adjacent pixels was over the certain value, it was judged as the edges of the magnetic domains. The edges of the magnetic domains were quantitatively detected. The minimum resolution was ~500 nm which was consistent with the value conventionally obtained by the mapping of the brightness mapping of the images. These results indicate that the automatic detection of the edges of the magnetic domains by the proposed algorism was achieved. In the future, we will apply this method to in-Situ observation of the magnetic domains."
9,11,EFFECT OF DUST PROOF DEVICE OF BLOWDOWN WIND TUNNEL INLET ON THE MAIN STREAM,"It is well known that mainstream turbulent intensity in wind tunnel experiments affects flow transition and separation. In order to reduce the mainstream turbulent intensity, the rectification condition inside the wind tunnel is shown. However, the turbulence intensity did not decrease even if the conditions were satisfied in the wind tunnel of our laboratory. As a cause, it was found that the turbulence from the dust proof device at the air inlet of blower fan is not rectified even if it passes through the rectification unit. In this research, it is investigated the relationship between the turbulent intensity of mainstream and the dust proof device of blower fan.
In the experiment, 4 types of dust proof felt with different resistance values K are installed on the wire mesh installed in the blower fan. Felt A is a non-woven fabric sheet for gardening, and felt B ~ D are fan filters with different thickness. The average velocity Uave and turbulent intensity Urms are calculated from the fluctuation velocity measured by hot-wire anemometer at the center of the wind tunnel exit. The main stream velocity is adjusted by changing the blower fan inverter frequency from 0 to 60Hz.
The average velocity distribution is shown in Fig. 1, and the turbulent intensity distribution is shown in Fig. 2. The average velocity becomes slower in proportion to the resistance value K. On the other hand, the turbulent intensity distribution is not the only effect of resistance value K."
9,11,"Luminance Distribution and Stress Analysis
at the Stress Concentration Area using Mechanoluminescence","Currently, there are about 700,000 bridges in Japan. However, about 20[%] of these have been over 50 years old, and aging such as fatigue cracks and corrosion is considered serious. Therefore, it is important to grasp the deterioration situation on-site as soon as possible. One method is non-destructive inspection. But there are drawbacks such as high skill required for inspectors and inspection only within a narrow range. Accordingly, we focus on a material called Mechanoluminescence Materials and aim to develop a new non-destructive inspection technology that can be inspected for simpler and wider than the conventional method.
Mechanoluminescence Materials has the property that the stress concentration part emits light when mechanical external force is applied in the phosphorescent state(Fig.1).
The purpose of this study is to verify whether the luminance distribution and FEM have a high correlation even when the stress distribution is complicated by multiple defects. Tensile test was performed by applying mechanoluminescence material to two test pieces with one and three holes damaged. In comparison with the maximum principal stress, the distribution was similar in both the single hole and the three hole. In comparison with the equivalent stress, the distribution was close to more than the maximum principal stress between the three holes. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the analysis of complex stress fields."
9,7,Study on Surface Roughness Analysis Method Using the Least-Squares Fitting for Plateau Surface Texture with Insufficient Plateau Structure ,"
Roughness analysis methods for plateau structure surface have been proposed by ISO standards [1], JIS, and previous researches [2]. However, these analysis methods [1, 2] have a problem that the roughness parameter Rpq in the plateau area of the surface with insufficient plateau structure cannot be calculated. These problems are because of the surfaces with insufficient plateau structure have a narrow plateau area of the material probability curve (MPC). Development of a new roughness analysis method that can analyze surfaces with insufficient plateau structure is indispensable for revealing the progress of plateau surface wear demanded by the industry. We want to contribute engine performance improvements and CO2 emission reduction from automobiles by solving these problems related to the plateau surface. Therefore, this study develops a new analysis method that can evaluate to surfaces with insufficient plateau structure. The procedure of the proposal analysis method in this paper is as follows. 1. The variation in inclination of MPC i.e. the differential values, is obtained by scanning the window function from the left end of MPC to the right end and fitting the least-square line to the data in the window. 2. Local peaks and valleys are detected because the plotted differential values is wavy. This detection of local peaks and valleys is a preparation for obtaining a global inclination. 3. Relatively small peaks and valleys are removed to detect relatively large peaks and valleys from the plotted differential values. 4. The thresholds are set for determinations of LPL (lower limit of plateau region) and UVL (upper limit of valley region). The last peak before exceeding the threshold from the left end of MPC is determined as LPL, the first valley that exceeds the threshold from the left end of MPC is determined as UVL. 5. The plateau region is set from the left end of MPC to the LPL, and the valley region is set from the UVL to the right end of MPC. 6. Roughness parameters are obtained by fitting a least-square line to the plateau region and the valley region. In this study, the above analysis procedure and algorithm were researched and developed. As a result, we succeeded in deriving the roughness parameter Rpq of the plateau area for surfaces with insufficient plateau structure by the above analysis procedure and algorithm. On the other hand, the proposal method in this paper has some problems. Correspondingly, we intend to develop further superior evaluation algorithm for plateau surface."
9,12,Self-healing of Ni/Al2O3 composites for achieve Circular Economy ,"Circular economy (CE) is an economic concept aimed to eliminate waste by reducing or minimizing waste from using of resources and the continual use with improving the productivity of resource and keep product or equipment in use for a longer time [1]. The CE concept is useful for establish sustainable society. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the Unites Nations concept which plans to action for people, planet and prosperity. The CE concept has the strongest relationship with SDG 8, 9, 12 and 15 which aim to sustainable economic development, sustainable environmental and sustainable social development. To achieve goals of the CE concept, self-healing materials will be proposed with their good properties such as high reliability and long lifetime. Alumina (Al2O3) has been widely used in industry because of their excellent properties such as high-temperature resistance, high hardness and high chemical stability. However, alumina is easy to be broken due to its brittleness. This weakness has been restricted to its application and lifetime. To overcome this weakness, dispersion of non-oxide phase such as nickel (Ni) to alumina matrix can increase their toughness and give self-healing function. The self-healing function in Ni/Al2O3 composites can increase the reliability and lifetime of these materials. Maruoka and Nanko reported self-healing of Ni/Al2O3 nanocomposites. Ni dispersoid in the matrix were oxidized at high temperatures in air. NiAl2O4 as the oxidation product was filled up the surface crack of the composite [2]. As well, Dake et al. reported repeatability of healing in Ni/Al2O3 [3]. In this paper, self-healing Ni/Al2O3 is discussed for using in CE to achieve the sustainable developments."
9,12,The MAX phase ceramics to achieve a circular economy ,"Circular economy (CE) has been proposed as a way to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Circular economy means an economy that does not produce waste by reusing resources at each stage of production, consumption and disposal[1]. The achievement of CE will improve the sustainability of society. In order to achieve CE, it is necessary to spread materials with high producibility and long lifetime. Conventional engineering ceramics have high production cost because of machining with diamond cutting tools and polishing for long time. They need smooth surface without cracks for removing surface crack, which reduce in mechanical strength. Ti2AlC ceramics is one of the MAX phase ceramics, which is the layered ternary transition metal carbides and nitrides. The non-oxide ceramics have received attentions due to their excellent mechanical properties, their good resistance against high-temperature oxidation and machinability via cemented carbide cutting tools. Ti2AlC ceramics has been studied as a potential candidate expected to be used in various mechanical components. Roughly machining Ti2AlC ceramics has high bending strength comparable with polished ones. This means the Ti2AlC ceramics has excellent capacity for high speed machining without surface damage leading to decrease their mechanical properties. Machining cost of the Ti2AlC ceramics is much lower than that of grinding of conventional engineering ceramics with diamond grinding wheel. As well Ti2AlC ceramics has been reported to have self-healing ability via thermal oxidation process [2]. When using self-healing Ti2AlC ceramics, surface cracks can be recovered by heat treatment in oxidizing atmosphere. Self-healing function of the Ti2AlC ceramics are very useful for achieving CE. The Ti2AlC ceramics are useful for achieving the SDGs by realizing a circular economy."
9,4,IMPROVEMENT OF MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FRICTION STIR WELDED T-LAP DISSIMILAR METAL JOINTS BY APPLYING TOOL OFFSET AND REVERSED METAL FLOW,"
In the recent years, the fuel efficiency, saving the materials, and environmental pollution have been becoming the great challenges to manufacturer. The uses of lightweight alloys such as titanium, aluminum, magnesium, etc., and hybrid materials consisting of dissimilar metals are considered as the suitable solutions to solve these difficulties. Currently, applying the conventional welding methods to join dissimilar metals has not been satisfactory in these requirements. Friction Stir Welding (FSW), a solid-state welding technique, is considered as new and earth friendly advanced technology to achieve good mechanical properties of the joint.
In this study, the effects of tool offset and the reversed metal flow induced by a double-pass welding on the characteristics of FSWed interface were investigated to fabricate higher performance dissimilar thickness T-lap joints between 7075-T651 and 5083-H116 aluminum alloys. The experimental works demonstrated the size of kissing bond defects could be reduced by offsetting the tool pin to the advancing side in the double-pass FSW. Application of the double-pass welding successfully improved the mechanical properties of the T-lap joint. The joint efficiency by combining these methods reached about 90% in comparison with the base metal."

There are applications in high technology areas like gas turbine and high speed transportation industry for the use of dissimilar metal friction stir welded joint between TRIP steel and mild steel. In the present study the fatigue behavior of the dissimilar joint between TRIP steel and mild steel is studied and compared with the behavior and properties of similar metal friction stir welded TRIP steel and monolithic TRIP and mild steel. The fatigue strength of the all the above mentioned were compared and microstructure analyzed. The microhardness distribution for dissimilar metal joint was obtained and variations were analyzed in stir zone.
9,12,"Study on collection system with pipe air flow for slitter rewinder (Joint research and education by Nagaoka University of Technology, National College of Technology and its local company) ","A slitter rewinder is a machine that rewinds a strip of paper or film, cuts it into strips of any width, and rewinds it. The slitter manufactured by Ebara Industries has a high reputation for quality and work efficiency and has the top share in Japan1). In the slitter processing, there are “ears” that are disposal portions at both ends of the material. The collect process for disposal part is one of the essential parts of slitter system. In order to collect the ears, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate tension to the ears in accordance with the winding speed. If the conditions are not appropriate, the processing part becomes twined around the rotating part and the entire system needs to be stopped. Ear processing capability is one of the important factors because it also becomes a bottleneck in the processing speed of the entire device. As the ear processing method, a method of mechanically winding up the ear portion and a method of sucking into the tube using the subsonic flow flowing in the circular tube have been put into practical use. The latter method is widely used for the slitter for oversea because of high cost performance. However, there are still many unclear adverse events for this technique, such as the mechanism of ears clogging and twisting. Understandings these phenomena may lead to the development of technique with excellent cost, performance and environmental impact.
In this study, we investigate the suction performance of the latter method on the main dimensions of the suction pipe using the computational fluid dynamic method. In addition, thouth this project, it become nice case study for collaboration work with Nagaka University of Tech., Tsuyama Kosen and its local company for not only research work, but also the purpose of human resource education."
9,12,"Effect of Width of Underlay to Cutting characteristics of Polystyrene Bars Subjected to
Wedge Indentation","A wedge indentation is widely used for cutting off a complicated-formed pattern from a sheet material.
But mostly researches were involve with the sheet material during wedge indentation process. So there were
insufficient theories to explain the cutting load response and deformation behavior of bars material during the
symmetry blade indentation process. However, several problems that affect to the product quality and cutting
possibility are caused by friction of underlay of the cutting process.
(1)
So, this research was aiming to compare cutting characteristics of Polystyrene (PS) square bars that subjected to indentation of a symmetry (42°) blade and mounted on Al5051 plate underlay Polystyrene (PS) square with bars that subjected to indentation of a symmetry (42°) and mounted on Al5051 anvil. In order to compare load resistant from cutting process, the FEM code (MSC.Marc-2015) were used along with the experiment for
-1
analysis. The indentation velocity was keeping 1 mm·s . From simulation, the result revealed that when varied
the width of underlay from 40 mm to 10 mm, the load response was not changed. While, in the experiment of indentation process when the width of underlay was 3 mm, the load response was decreased. Furthermore, the stroke of breakage and deformation of Polystyrene bar were detected by using a microscope CCD camera during the cutting process.

9,12,Research on Resistance of Membrane against Falling Object ,"Membranes for ceiling have strength that catches falling object softly [1], it is not, however, always possible to absorb shocks and broken depending on the mass and shape of the object. The purpose of present study is to examine the resistance of membrane against falling object from ceiling. An attempt to clarify the conditions of breakdown the membrane was carried out by analyzing Stress and deflection of the membrane generated by falling object. First, the mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced plastic membrane (GFRP) used in this study were measured by tensile test. Second, 3D models were created and analyzed by Finite Element Method (FEM) with a simulation code Fusion 360 [2]. In the simulation, each pile weighing 3kg and 7kg was dropped to the 400x400 and 1900x1900 GFRP. As a result, when the piles were dropped from a height of 1m, only the combination of 3kg pile, 400x400mm membrane caused rapture, and other combination, 7kg, 1400x1900mm did not rupture. Furthermore, the combination of 3kg, 400x400mm did not cause rupture when the height were 0.1m and 0.5m. Although the GFRP used in the present paper has almost linear tensile properties, viscoelastic materials will be investigated to expand the simulation as the further study."
9,,Two-dimentional functional thin film preparation by sputtering deposition using powder targets ,"We have been prepared functional thin films by sputtering deposition method using powder targets to prepare the thin film with certain element ingredients. In this method, several kind of powders were mixed by mixer, and just put on the target holder in the vacuum chamber. And then thin film were deposited on the substrate which was set to the counter side. We have been applied to the preparation of some functional thin films, for example, bismuth iron garnet (Bi3Fe5O12) films which used for magnet-optics , and Sn doped SiO2 thin films by sputtering using SnO2 and SiO2 mixed powder target [1, 2]. In those experiments, two- dimensional profiles of the prepared thin films were not uniform several time. In that preparation, used powder targets were not fully mixed and they showed distribution. Their two dimensional profiles was similar to the sputtering deposition target profile on the target holder. In this experiment, we tried to prepare functional thin film with two dimensional profile using target holder which have two-dimensional profile. The deposition chamber was made by stainless steel. First, the powder targets were set up on a stainless steel target holder. Target holder have four holes and four kinds of powder targets was put on the each holders. In this experiment, W, Ti, Al and SnO2 powders were used as the sputtering targets. The chamber was evacuated to 1 Pa using a rotary pump, and then to a base pressure of 5×10-3 Pa using a turbomolecular pump and rotary pump. The deposition total pressure (P) was 10 Pa and argon (Ar:99.99%) at a flow rate of 10 sccm. DC plasma was generated by DC power source, and discharge voltage was 800 V and discarge current was ~100mA. The Si and glass substrates located 2.0 cm from the target. The deposition time was fixed to 120 min, the substrate temperature (Ts) was increased from room temperature. In our previous work, XPS narrow spectra of the prepared film using SnO2 and SiO2 mixture powder target were measure. Clear (a)Si 2p, (b)Sn 3d5/2 and (c)O1s peaks
were observed, which means the prepared films were Sn
doped SiO2. Fig. 1 shows the dependence of the Sn and
Si concentration ratio on the SnO2 and SiO2 mixture
powder target. As the results, Sn and Si concentration
ratio was almost linearly increased with increasing SnO2
and SiO2 powder mixture.
 Two dimensional elements profile of the surface of the deposition film was measured by EDX (EDAX; Genesis XM2). The results suggest that there are four elements of W, Ti, Al and Sn, on the surface of the film and their profile of the film was similar to that of the targets. The results suggest that two dimensional functional thin film can be prepared using the new sputtering deposition method using powder target."
9,8,Robustness Analysis of Force Control System Considering Vibration Suppression for Co-operative Robot ,"In 2013, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare deregulated an industrial robot. Thereby, under the suitable installation condition, the industrial robot can operate as co-operative robot, without the safety fence. Recent years, the co-operative robot is focused from two points of view. Firstly, by removing the safety fence, the user can save the installation space and reduce the cost of safety fence. Secondly, the co-operative robot expands the application of industrial robot because the co-operative robot can work with people. Thereby, the co-operative robot can operate the work which is difficult for the usual industrial robot. Generally, features of environment, such as the stiffness, shape and weight of contact target, is inconcrete. Furthermore, the vibration of robot arm is caused by the weight saving and miniaturization. Therefore, the contact stability analysis considering these problem is important for the co-operative robot.
Considering this problem, this paper proposes the force control system considering the contact to environment and the vibration suppression of reduction gear for the co-operative robot. Furthermore, by using the small gain theorem, this paper analyzes the contact stability concerning the contact target having various environmental stiffness. The analysis results show that the stable area becomes broader by the increment of environmental stiffness. However, the cutoff frequency which satisfy the internal stability of disturbance observer is increase. It is noted that this analysis results are obtained by the provisional parameters. As future works, the authors reanalyze the contact stability after identifying the mechanical parameters of experimental robot arm."
9,7,Study on melting mechanism of CFRTP by induction heating simulation ,"Thermoplastic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRTP) has been increasingly used as a hydrogen tank reinforcement for automobiles, aircraft, concrete structures, and fuel cell vehicles because of its high added value. This material is essential for the realization of a sustainable society and a strong infrastructure society. Fusion bonding is used to bond CFRTP; however, defects can occur because of poor welding. Additionally, when CFRTP is molded, its durability deteriorates because of contamination and air bubbles. This study uses a finite element simulation to clarify the mechanism of CFRTP melting by an induction heating coil. Using finite element software (COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4), we analyze the eddy current density and temperature distribution induced in CFRTP by various coils. The CFRTP was designed using 3D CAD (SOLIDWORKS 2018 ×64 Edition). First, CAD data were imported using the COMSOL Multiphysics CAD import module to create a finite element model. The physical properties of the CFRTP sheets and pellets were obtained by measuring their thermal diffusivity using a xenon flash analyzer. Further, a specific resistance hole measurement system was used to measure the resistance value to obtain the conductivity. Using this approach, we performed eddy current analysis and heat transfer analysis via the finite element method. Fig. 1 shows the results of the finite element analysis of the interaction of eddy currents between a hat-type CFRTP and a rectangular coil. The excitation frequency and current of the coil were 15 kHz and 13.5 A, respectively. We determined high eddy currents and temperatures directly under the coil windings. However, the melting temperature of the CFRTP could not be reached. In the future, finite element analysis will be conducted together with induction heating experiments."
9,11,Scene Prediction by Feedforward Neural Networks ,"1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, neural networks[1] have been
used in many places. Pattern recognition includes image recognition[2] and voice recognition. One of them is used for self-driving technology. Self-driving technologies include “detection of objects by radar or camera (recognition)”, “determination of how to move objects (judgement)”, “determination of vehicle reaction and execution method based on prediction (operation)” .
In this study, we predict the scene that leads to the“ judgment” directly linked to the safety of automated driving. The purpose of this study is to obtain a prediction scene as output by creating a feedforward neural network[4] and entering the video into the program.
2. SCENE PREDICTION
Neural networks are better at pattern
recognition. Pattern recognition is the process of making the observation pattern correspond to one of the concepts when the recognition target can be classified into several concepts. With pattern recognition, you can check for unknown input data whether there is a known pattern (such as characters, faces, or words) in it. For example, camera applications have the ability to automatically detect faces. In this case, the ""unknown input data"" is the ""image shown in the camera"", and the ""known pattern"" is the ""face"". Fig.1 is a conceptual view of scene prediction. The scene prediction is to predict a scene several seconds after the input moving image. Therefore,

In this study, a three-layer feedforward neural
network was used. The back propagation method was used as a learning rule. The scene (one frame image of the video) is input, and the output recalls the scene after a few seconds. In this study, we analyzed two types of analysis: next scene prediction, which predicts only the next scene, and continuous scene prediction, which predicts all subsequent scenes when the first one scene is input. Currently learning and recalling two types of videos."
9,11,Scene Prediction by Discrete Time Recurrent Neural Networks ,"Automobile manufacturers around the world are focusing on the development of autonomous driving technology in order to provide safe and comfortable vehicles and create new transportation systems[1]. In the field of automated driving, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are drawing attention[2]. The realization of autonomous driving requires technology for predicting the future scene from the current scene: the situation of movement of surrounding cars and people on road. The scene prediction technique is possible to predict hazards, which leads to accident prevention. This research aim is scene prediction for automatic driving by machine learning using recurrent neural networks. In this study, scene prediction is performed on trains with monotonous movements that are relatively easy to predict, as a first step in realizing autonomous driving. It is assumed that recurrent neural networks capable of processing time-series data are effective for scene prediction. Since the number of neurons can be reduced compared to the feedforward network with backpropagation learning of the conventional method, the amount of calculation is reduced and an improvement in learning speed is expected. The learning algorithm of discrete time recurrent neural network is derived and applied to scene prediction. By proposing a new model that is different from the conventional method, we believe that we can contribute to the search for possibilities and the development of autonomous driving."
9,8,Development of Pulse Power-Supply Unit for Segmented Electrode Faraday MHD Accelerator ,"Presently, we have ever been performing plasma acceleration experiment using small MHD channel of consecutive electrode faraday type which is shown in Fig.1. Figure 2 shows segmented Faraday type MHD accelerator. The advantage of this type is to connect power supply with each electrodes and it is possible to accelerate powerfully. In addition this method can reduce current density of the x-direction. However, there is issues of weight for power-supply and capacity in this type for the operation. Therefore we propose the circuit which can divide the output into a multi-electrode pairs from single power supply in this study using by FPGA."

Figure 2(a) is the primary voltage waveform, and Fig. 2(b), (c) are the secondary voltage waveform. The secondary voltage was divided by resistors of 100 kΩ and thus the output voltage of the pulser is the total of Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c). The output voltage of the pulser was 45 kV and the pulse width was 100 ns (FWHM) at the first peak. We study the switching circuit of the pulser, and evaluate the timing jitter."
9,7,Numerical analysis of orbit of charged particles for laser ion source with solenoid magnetic field ,"A laser ion source is one of the candidates for providing a high-flux ion beam. In the laser ion source, ablation
  plasma with high drift velocity is generated by irradiating an intense laser on a solid target. Since the ablation –3
plasma spreads three dimensionally, the ion current density decreases with L , where L is the drift distance. In order to prevent this expansion of the plasma and to increase the ion current density, the application of a solenoid

understanding the behavior of the laser ablation plasma in the solenoid magnetic field is required for the optimized design of the beam current waveform and the magnetic field. In this study, we numerically analyze the orbit of charged particles in the solenoid magnetic field.
We have performed a particle simulation as shown in Fig. 1. The orbit of the charged particles is analyzed as below:"
9,7,PRODUCTION OF MULTI-CHARGED ALUMINUM IONS USING AN EVAPORATION SOURCE IN AN ECR ION SOURCE ,"The electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source has a long life because it is an electrodeless ion source that does not use a filament and so on. In addition, it is expected as a multi-charged ion source that is easily industrialized.
In semiconductor manufacturing, ion implantation for doping impurities into a substrate material has become an indispensable technique. Therefore, we are conducting research to develop a technology for implanting aluminum ions into SiC, which is a substrate material, in power semiconductor manufacturing. The keys are to confirm the production of aluminum multi-charged ions and to improve the production rate.
Figure 1 shows the results of verification of the production of multi-charged aluminum ions using a sputtering source. The x-axis (m/z) of the graph indicates the mass-to-charge ratio (number of atoms / charge). The mass-to- charge ratios of singly charged aluminum ions (Al1+) and doubly charged aluminum ions (Al2+) are 27 and 27/2=13.5, respectively. From this result, when the sputtering source voltage was -400 V, the current amount of Al1+ was detected at about 32.3 nA. However, it was not possible to confirm multi-charged ions more than doubly charged ions. The reason is that a certain
amount of aluminum atoms could not be supplied in the plasma after sputtering [1].
Therefore, we are planning to solve the problem by supplying vaporized aluminum directly into the plasma. In the presentation, the progress about the aluminum evaporation source will be reported."
9,11,Feedforward Control to Reduce Periodic Disturbance for Rotary Compressor ,"1. Introduction
Recently, compressor motor that used for air conditioner and refrigerator is becoming more downsized and more enlarge capacity. The demand for large-scale air conditioning is increasing, and reliability is also regarded as important in data centers. The pressure change that occurs when the compressor motor rotates increases speed vibration as the capacity increases. The vibration reduces reliability. In this paper, a feed-forward control to suppress the speed vibration and improve the vibration suppression performance.
2. Rotary Compressor
Although there are various types of compressors, this research is aimed at rotary compressors that are inexpensive and have a wide range of applications. The rotary compressor has a mechanism that prepares a piston provided eccentrically with a cylinder, and compresses the space by driving the piston with a motor. For this reason, the load torque periodically pulsates according to the mechanical angle phase, and causes speed vibration.
3. Speed Control System for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor
Fig. 1 shows a speed control system. P (s) and C (s) are a plant and a speed controller, respectively.

Where, J is moment of inertia, D is friction
coefficient, Kp is proportional gain, Ki is

disturbance torque TL, a periodic disturbance
occurs due to a pressure change determined by
the structure of the rotary compressor. By the
speed control system shown in Fig.1, speed response follows its reference averagely. However, if speed control bandwidth is low, the speed ripple due to the disturbance torque remains.
4. Feedforward Control System Using Periodicity
The disturbance torque described above is a periodic one that vibrates according to the mechanical angle. This paper proposes a feedforward control system that suppresses speed vibration using this periodicity. Fig. 2 shows the proposed feedforward control system [1]. A control system using the speed deviation eω as an input is connected in parallel so that eω becomes zero. P(z) and C(z) are a transfer function obtained by z-transforming P(s) and C(z), respectively. To set the transfer function up to the speed response to 1, the transfer function Gff(z) of the feedforward control system is set to the reciprocal of the closed-loop transfer function of the speed control system in Fig. 2. To apply feedforward control, the past value
stored in the memory and used as the future value because the disturbance is periodic. Fig. 3 shows simulation results. As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed method reduces the speed ripple by 96.45%."
9,7,Terahertz Conductivity of Nanocellulose Composite Films Controlled with PEDOT:PSS Blending Ratio ,"Nanocellulose is a nature-based material produced from wood in the shape of nanometer-thick fibrils and nanometer-sized crystals and has advantages such as optical transparency, mechanical strength/flexibility, and environmental sustainability. If nanocellulose is provided with conductivity, it can be applied to organic optoelectronics and will be helpful for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 7. However, it is not well understood how we can control the optoelectronic nature of carriers introduced into nanocellulose. In this work, we investigated the conductivity spectra of carriers in nanocellulose composite films with various blending ratios (050%) of the conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS by using terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy, where THz electromagnetic waves with both radio-wave and light-wave natures are generated and detected.
We fabricated free-standing composite films of nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) and PEDOT:PSS and transmitted THz waves through them. The transmitted THz waveforms exhibited larger time delays and smaller amplitudes for higher PEDOT:PSS blending ratios [1]. This means that the velocity of the THz waves decreases and the absorption coefficient increases in the NFC composite. By performing the Fourier transformation of the measured THz waveforms, we obtained the complex conductivity spectra of carriers induced by PEDOT:PSS [2]. The magnitude of complex conductivity increased with increasing PEDOT:PSS blending ratio, showing an increase in carrier density. Furthermore, the spectral shapes of complex conductivity, which were successfully fitted with an extended Drude model [3], indicated that the spatial delocalization degree of the carriers becomes larger as the PEDOT:PSS blending ratio increases [1]. Our findings offer a physical insight into how the optoelectronic nature of carriers in nanocellulose composites can be modified by conductive materials, suggesting potential usefulness of nanocellulose for SDGs 9 and 7."
9,7,Modeling of magnetization reversal by micromagnetics ,"The applications of magnetic materials to electronic devices are attracting attention for the development of high- density magnetic storage using tunnel magnetoresistance using ferromagnetic metals, and of novel device containing carrier induced ferromagnetism of ferromagnetic semiconductors [1]. In recent years, because the device scale has been miniaturized, it is necessary to numerical simulate the dynamic behavior of magnetization in the mesoscopic region of ferromagnet. In particular, the determination of the physical parameters of ferromagnetic materials for magnetic devices is essential.
In this report, a model that can simulate magnetization reversal is created by micromagnetics calculation that can analyze the magnetization vector in a material. The dynamic behavior of magnetization is calculated by micromagnetic simulations, which are based on solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation that represents the precession of magnetization [2]. The code and interface to specify simulations are written in C# and Unity. The LLG equation is solved using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method. The effective magnetic field includes the external magnetic field, the demagnetizing field, magnetic anisotropy field, exchange field, and thermal noise.
Fig. 1 shows magnetization applied magnetic field parallel to x-direction. The size of unit magnetization was 10x10x10 nm. Damping constant and magnetization were 0.05 and 2.0 T, respectively. On that day, we will report on the dynamic behavior when each parameter is changed."
9,7,Photocatalytic activity of Fe-plated W sheet ,"The wastewater emitted by houses and industries is now a threat to the environment. The cleanup of organic pollutants in water is a complex problem [1]. Photocatalytic materials are actively studied because they decompose organic pollutants by strong redox action on their surface irradiated with light [2]. WO3 is a prospective candidate as a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst due to its band gap between 2.4 and 2.8 eV [2]. There are reports showing that the photocatalytic activity is improved by adding various metal elements (such as Mg, Zn, Fe, Mo) to WO3 [3]. In particular, Fe element attracts attention because it enhances absorption of visible light and effectively converts and separates photoexcited electrons and holes [3]. There are few reports on the effect of Fe- loading onto tungsten metal on photocatalytic activity. In this study, Fe-plated W sheet were prepared and their photocatalytic activity was evaluated.
The plating solution was prepared by mixing iron (III) nitrate and purified water. The concentration of Fe was 0.5 mol / L. The anode and the cathode were Fe sheet (0.5 mm×20 mm, purity 99.5 %) and W sheet (0.5 mm×20 mm, purity 99.95 %), respectively. The current ran through the solution at 40 mA for 35 min.
The transmittance at 665 nm of the methylene blue (MB) solution not containing W sheet hardly changed after 5 h light irradiation (Fig.1). On the other hand, the transmittances of MB solutions containing W sheet and Fe-plated W sheet increased about 15 and 30%, respectively. It is supposed that the natural oxide film on the surface of the W sheet absorbs blue LED light and decomposes MB. The photocatalytic activity of W sheet with Fe was higher than that of the sheet without Fe. It is considered that the Fe small particles formed on the surface improve the photocatalytic activity of natural oxide film on the surface of the W sheet."
9,7,"Crystal structure and luminescence properties of Pr-activated Ca2-xAxLaNbO6 (A = Sr, Ba)","Commercial white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs) are produced through the combination of blue-chip (GaN) and yellow phosphor (YAG: Ce). The W-LEDs shows a cold white light because of the lack of a red component. Searching for new red-emitting phosphors suitable for blue-LED-excitation is required [1]. Ca2LaNbO6 with double perovskite structure are formed when the B site of ABO3 is occupied by two different cations (La, Nb), and it may become a suitable host material for phosphors by structural modulation [2]. In this work, the effect of Sr and Ba substitution on the luminescence of Pr-activated Ca2-xAxLaNbO6 (A = Sr and Ba) was investigated.
The samples were prepared by solid-state reaction. Powders of CaCO3, SrCO3, BaCO3, La2O3, Nb2O5, and Pr6O11 were used as starting materials. The mixture of the powders was pressed into pellets at a uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa. The pellets were subsequently sintered at 1300 for 6 h in air.
Fig.1 shows Sr and Ba content dependence of the lattice paramete which is an angle between a and c in monoclinic structure. The lattice constant was determined using XRD peaks and . From the XRD ed only for samples having a Ca2LaNbO6 crystal structure. For Sr substitution, lattice with increasing x, and reached its minimum value of 89.53 ° at x = 0.9, and then increased with further increasing x. Ba substitution showed similar behavior. The emission peak of the samples excited at 450 nm was observed at 500, 544, 622 and 655 nm. Fig.2 shows the relationship between the red emission intensity at 655 nm and the substitution amount of Sr or Ba. The emission intensity at 655 nm showed a ect in the

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the dependence temperature of the energy transfer in YVO4:Ln3+ (Ln= Eu, Dy, Sm, Er) phosphors quantitatively. The YVO4:Ln3+ were prepared by the citrate complex polymerization method with the concentration of 2% each. The luminescence properties of YVO4:Ln3+ were investigated by changing the excitation wavelength and the temperature by 20K to 300K. The energy transfer mechanism has been confirmed due to efficient energy transfer from the vanadate group to Ln3+ [1-2]. From the result, it is found that the more increasement of the temperature is, the weaker emission of VO43- is and the stronger Ln3+ emission become. From the measured result, we have been able to calculate the energy rate between the host, VO43- and Ln3+ base on the energy transfer model [3] as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In this report, we will discuss the energy transfer model and the difference in transfer rate by Ln3+ ions in details."

9,4,The effect of Bi concentration on temperature dependence of YVO4:Bi phosphor emission for non-contact temperature sensor,"Yttrium orthovanadate phosphor doped with bismuth ion (YVO4:Bi3+) phosphor has been known to exhibit high efficiency yellow emission through the energy transfer from VO43- to Bi3+ by near-ultraviolet light excitation [1]. Furthermore, our previous research found that the emission color changes from yellow to blue emission by changing from room temperature to low temperature (20 K) [2]. We considered that this characteristic could be applied to a non-contact temperature sensor. In the case of room temperature, were found that the optimal concentration of Bi ion is from 1 % to 2 %, but the optimal concentration on temperature change has not been clarified. Therefore, were synthesized by Polymerized Complex Method (PCM) to study its optical properties. During this research different YVO4:Bi3+ are synthesized using various amounts of bismuth to analyze their reaction and thus characterize the emission wavelength range of each as well as its photoluminescence intensity (PL) at different temperatures. Finally, by comparing these results, were evaluated the optimal concentration of Bi ion on temperature dependence."
9,7,Basic Study on Melting and Cutting Simulation by a Laser Irradiation ,"In decommissioning of the Fukushima-Daiichi Newly Developed nuclear power plant, fuel debris is removed from the side of the reactor pressure vessel to the outside and stored in a storage container. In this process, the removed fuel debris is finely cut so that it can be inserted in the storage container. This cutting is performed by using the laser technique. That is, the removed fuel debris is melted and cut by a laser irradiation, and divided into several pieces. Each piece is inserted into the storage container. In this case, it is expected that a radioactive contamination area is expended by scattering of the radioactivated dust generated by the laser cutting. Then, to suppress scattering of the radioactivated dust and expansion of the contamination area, capture of the radioactivated dust by a water jet is considered. Cutting of the material by the laser technique and capture of the cutting waste by the jet are already studied [1-4]. The purpose of the present study is to confirm numerically the validity of the melting and cutting method of the fuel debris by the laser irradiation and the capture of the radioactive dust by the water jet using the latest CFD code.
Table 1 shows initial and boundary conditions of the present sample simulation. The water jet is injected from the upper location with the slant angle of 45 degrees to the laser irradiation area.

We evaluate a comfortable test signal using Human Computation with Crowdsourcing. We propose a Indicators for designing comfortable test signal by combining these two methods.

Recently, a new class of structural materials, termed as high entropy alloys (HEAs), has been developed. In this study, we developed a novel TiNbTaZrMo high-entropy alloy (HEA)

This study implies the possibility of using HEAs as a new class of metallic biomaterials."

9,11,Development of determination method of singlet oxygen in the air using a polymer sheet containing a spin trap reagent ,"Introduction Singlet oxygen is one of reactive oxygen species(ROS) and has high reactivity, and can be
sterilized[1]. However, a method for determination of singlet oxygen concentration in the air has not been established. Iwamori et al. reported a 1O2 detection sheet (PVATEMP sheet) containing a spin trap reagent 4- hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (4-H-TEMP) and its ESR signal based on singlet oxygen produced from photosensitizer in a chamber filled with pure oxygen under reduced pressure (95 kPa). Assuming that 4-H-TEMP react with 1O2 quite efficiently, the stable radical species 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl (4-H-
1
TEMPOL) occurs quantitatively (Fig.1 (1)), therefore, O2 can be determined by comparing a ESR intensity of
unknown sample to that of a sample with known concentration. In this study, a determination method of 1O2 in the air was proposed by improving the PVATEMP sheet and evaluating it with an endperoxide 3- (1,4-Epidioxy-4- methyl-1,4-dihydro-1naphthyl) propionic acid (EP) that releases 1O2 by heat quantitatively (Eq.(2)).
Experimental 50 mg / ml PVA (22-88, Kuraray) aqueous solution and 4-H-TEMP aqueous solution were
mixed in 1 ml portions, put into a 40 mm petri dish and dried at 35 ° C. to prepare a PVATEMP sheet.The EP reagent(Kyoto Spin Lab) was quickly weighed on a sheet and dispersed on the sheet with 100 μl of toluene cooled to 20 ° C or lower. The plate was placed on a hot plate at 50 ° C and heated for 4 hours while being shielded from light. After the reaction, the sheet was dissolved with 1 ml of pure water and ESR measurement was performed.
Results and discussion As a result of preparing a PVATEMP sheet having a 4-H-TEMP concentration of 20
μM to 200 mM, crystals were deposited on a sheet having a 4-H-TEMP concentration exceeding 120 mmol. Therefore, it was confirmed that the upper limit of the amount of TEMP added to a uniform sheet using 50 mg PVA needs to be lower than 120 mmol. As a result of ESR measurement of the reaction between singlet oxygen released from the EP reagent and 4-H-TEMP in the 100 mmol PVATEMP sheet, the TEMPOL signal intensity, that is, the TEMPOL concentration also increased in proportion to the EP concentration (Fig. 1). However, a 1.76 μmol TEMPOL signal was observed even in blanks without EP. It is thought to be caused by PVA or atmospheric oxygen. Using an approximate expression that excludes the intercept because the blank value is not derived from EP, based on the amount of 1O2 generated from EP and the concentration of 4-H-TEMP added to the PVATEMP sheet, the reaction rate of 4-H-TEMP in the PVATEMP sheet was calculated to be 18.8%.This is thought to be due to the fact that 1O2 generated
from EP did not react with 4-H-TEMP and was deactivated by quencher substances and PVA in the air [3]. In the future, the appearance of the TEMPOL signal in the blank is considered to be caused by PVA. Therefore, we will investigate the film thickness and polymer of the 20μm PVATEMP sheet and aim to standardize singlet oxygen measurement data using the optimized sheet."

9,12,"Functional analysis of the lignostilbene a,b-dioxygenase genes involved in the catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds ","Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 is a Gram-negative bacterium that can degrade various lignin-derived aromatic compounds. To date, we isolated the SYK-6 genes involved in the catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds, and these catabolic genes are expected to be useful for the production of value-added compounds from lignin. In this study, we focused on the catabolism of dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DCA), which is a phenylcoumaran-type dimer compound containing the b-5 linkage that accounts for ca. 3–10% in lignin. SYK- 6 converts DCA into a stilbene-type compound, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-5- methoxyphenyl)acrylic acid (DCA-S), via five reaction steps [1]. The double bond connecting the aromatic rings of DCA-S is cleaved to form vanillin and 5-formylferulate, which are further catabolized. Although the enzyme genes involved in the conversion of DCA to DCA-S have been identified and characterized [1–3], little is known about the enzyme genes responsible for the conversion of DCA-S. Here we identified the genes encoding DCA- S-converting enzymes in SYK-6.
In a previous study, the lignostilbene a,b-dioxygenase (LSD) gene was suggested to be involved in the conversion of DCA-S in a Sphingomonas strain [4]. In the SYK-6 genome, we found eight LSD-like genes. qRT- PCR analysis revealed that lsdA, lsdG, and lsdH were highly transcribed in SYK-6 cells grown in LB. Because the conversion of DCA-S was enhanced in SYK-6 cells when incubating with vanillate, an intermediate metabolite of DCA, qRT-PCR analysis was also performed using mRNA obtained from the cells cultured in the presence of vanillate. In this condition, lsdD was highly transcribed in addition to lsdA, lsdG, and lsdH, indicating that the transcription of lsdD was highly induced (32-fold) in the presence of vanillate. To examine the ability of the eight Lsd-like gene products to convert DCA-S, each gene was expressed in E. coli or Pseudomonas putida, and the gene products were purified. Among these Lsd-like enzymes, LsdA, LsdC, LsdD, and LsdG were able to convert DCA-S into vanillin and 5-formylferulate. Disruption of each of lsdD and lsdG resulted in a decrease in the ability to convert DCA-S while lsdA and lsdC mutants transformed the substrate as well as wild type. Furthermore, an lsdD lsdG double mutant almost lost its activity toward DCA-S. These results strongly suggest that lsdD and lsdG are mainly involved in the DCA-S conversion in SYK-6."
9,15,"Optimization of culture conditions for improving the efficiency of cis,cis-muconate production from lignin ","Lignin, one of the major components of woody biomass, is the most abundant aromatic compound on earth. Microbial production of cis,cis-muconate (ccMA), a platform chemical for polymer synthesis, from heterogeneous lignin-derived aromatic compounds obtained by chemical depolymerization of lignin has attracted attention as a promising strategy for lignin valorization. Recently, we isolated Pseudomonas sp. strain NGC7 that grows well on various lignin-derived aromatic compounds as a carbon source and successfully created its metabolically engineered strain, NGC703(pTS084), producing ccMA. This strain was able to produce ccMA from guaiacyl-type lignin-derived compounds, vanillin (VN) and vanillate (VA), while growing on syringyl-type compounds, syringaldehyde (SN) and syringate (SA) (Shinoda, E. et al., 2019). This strain was also applicable to produce ccMA from lignin-derived compounds, containing SN, SA, VN, and VA obtained from birch by alkaline- nitrobenzene oxidation (bNBL). In this study, we investigated the optimal culture conditions using a fed-batch bioreactor to improve the efficiency of ccMA production previously demonstrated using shake-flasks.
First, to determine the appropriate timing to start feeding of a bNBL model mix (8.6 mM SN, 1.4 mM SA, 4.3 mM VN, and 0.2 mM VA), NGC703(pTS084) cells pre-cultured in 10 mM SA were cultured with the bNBL model mix, and cell growth and concentration of each aromatic compound were monitored. SN was immediately converted to SA from the beginning of the culture, accumulating a significant amount of SA. SA was then started to be degraded at ca. 12 h, and the cells entered the logarithmic growth phase. After ca. 22 h, SA was completely disappeared, and cell growth was stopped. Based on these observations, we evaluated the effect of feeding timing on ccMA production. When the feeding was started at the beginning of SA conversion (after 12 h) with a rate of 0.72 mM bNBL model mix /h, SA and VA were significantly accumulated during culture. By contrast, almost no accumulation of SA and VA was observed when the feeding was started just before the depletion of SA (after 22 h). The ccMA titer (1.43 g/L) after 48 h of culture that started feeding after 22 h was 1.2 times higher than the culture that began feeding after 12 h. We further examined the effect of an increased feeding rate of the bNBL model mix (0.87 mM/h) on ccMA production. In this condition, the ccMA titer after 48 h of culture increased to 1.67 g/L."
9,12,"Exploration and characterization of microorganisms that cleave -aryl ether, the most abundant inter-unit linkage in lignin ","Lignin is a major component of wood, along with cellulose and hemicellulose, and is the most abundant aromatic compound on earth. Currently, one of the most promising strategies to valorize lignin is a combination of the decomposition of lignin using chemical catalysts and the microbial conversion of resultant heterogeneous aromatic monomers and oligomers into platform chemicals. The -aryl ether linkage (−O−4) is the most abundant inter-unit linkage accounting for approximately 50% of lignin. Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 is one of the best- characterized bacteria capable of catabolizing various lignin-derived compounds, including guaiacylglycerol-- guaiacyl ether (GGE), a model −O−4 dimer. In SYK-6 cells, GGE is catabolized via ether cleavage to generate -hydroxypropiovanillone (HPV) and guaiacol. This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases (GST), called -etherases. To date, −O−4 cleavage enzymes have been found only in limited bacteria and fungi, and they are all classified to be GST. The discovery of powerful −O−4 cleaving enzymes and novel types of enzymes/pathways will stimulate lignin valorization. In this study, we explored for microorganisms capable of cleaving the −O−4 linkage.
First, to evaluate the −O−4 cleavage reaction quickly and easily, we synthesized guaiacylglycerol -O-4- methylumbelliferone (GOU) that releases 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), a fluorescent substance, after the cleavage of -aryl ether. Because most of the lignin-derived compounds, including GGE, are known to be degraded via vanillate (VA) or syringate (SA), we screened microbial strains that grew on agar plates containing 5 mM VA or 5 mM SA as the sole source of carbon and energy from 160 environmental samples. The resulting 547 strains were cultured in 0.02 mM GOU + 5 mM VA or 0.02 mM GOU + 5 mM SA for 72 h, and fluorescence derived from 4MU was measured. Remarkable fluorescence was detected in 70 strains, indicating that these strains cleaved the −O−4 linkage of GOU. Resting cells of these 70 strains and SYK-6 prepared from cells cultured in 5 mM VA or 5 mM SA were incubated with 0.1 mM GGE, and the cultures were periodically analyzed by HPLC. Eight strains produced HPV and guaiacol from GGE, supporting that these strains have −O−4 cleaving enzymes. One of these strains converted GGE significantly faster than SYK-6."
9,15,Effects of Adding Microbial Material to Hydroponic Nutrient Solution on Bacterial Rhizosphere Community Structures of Tomatoes,"The microbiota in the rhizosphere (microbes surrounding roots) plays an important role for plant growth and health, plant nutrient availability and plant nutrient uptake. In this study, the effects of adding microbial material to a nutrient solution in hydroponics of tomato on the bacterial rhizosphere community structure and the emergence of plant pathogenic bacteria were investigated. The microbial material consists of genus Lactobacillus. The microbial material was added periodically into the hydroponic nutrient solution through the tomato cultivation period. To assess the bacterial community structures in the tomato rhizospheres, bacterial genomic DNA were extracted from the two roots (microbial material application and non-treated control). A partial sequence of the 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) of these extracted genomic DNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primer pair 357F and 517R. The purified PCR products (approximately 160 bp) were cloned into plasmid vector (pANT vector) with TA cloning kit, and the construct was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells. Plasmids containing the insert of the 16S rDNA were generally purified from the transformed Escherichia coli colonies. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned 16S rDNA were sequenced using M13 forward primer, an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. 35 and 43 sequences of 16S rDNA were obtained from the application and non-treated control, respectively. The obtained sequences of the 16S rDNA were compared to reference sequence available in the GenBank database using the BLAST standard nucleotide-nucleotide basic local alignment search tool. These results revealed that no significant differences were found in bacterial rhizosphere community structure between the application and non-treated control."
9,7,Isolation and Identification of Formic Acid Tolerant Yeast Cell from Environmental Samples ,"This study was carried out to isolate and identify formic acid tolerant microbes (bacteria, yeast and fungi) from natural environmental samples. A total of 8 strains of the formic acid tolerant microbes were isolated from 17 samples. The isolation of the microbes was done using formic acid-utilized medium supplemented with formic acid. One yeast strain, designated strain F01, was isolated from peel of lemon fruit. Strain F01 can grow on the formic acid-utilized medium in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Strain F01 was identified by DNA sequencing analysis of the D1/D2 region of the large subunit (28S) ribosomal DNA. The D1/D2 region of the isolated yeast (strain F01) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primer pair NL1 and NL2. The purified PCR product was cloned into plasmid vector (pANT vector) with TA cloning kit, and the construct was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells. Plasmid DNA containing the insert of the D1/D2 region was generally purified from four of the transformed E. coli colonies. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned D1/D2 region of the purified plasmid DNA were directly sequenced using M13 forward and M13 reverse primers, an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. The obtained sequence of the D1/D2 region (613 bp) of the strain F01 was compared to reference sequence available in the GenBank database using the BLAST standard nucleotide-nucleotide basic local alignment search tool. The strain F01 showed 100% D1/D2 region sequence similarity to Meyerozyma guilliermondii."
9,3,Planarian cells purification by density gradient centrifugation ,"
Planarians have a very high regenerative ability because pluripotent stem cells exist throughout their body. We want to monitor the process of regeneration from one cell to one individual, and elucidate the development process which is still unclear in organisms. However, although the suitable culture media for planarian has been selected [1], the stem cells have not yet been proliferated successfully in a culture dish. The ultimate aim of one study is searching for growth factors of planarian cells.
Here, we examined the purification conditions of planarian cells by density gradient centrifugation [2]. First, to examine the suitable conditions for density gradient centrifugation, single layer centrifugation was carried out. Isolated planarian cells were mixed in a solution having a density of 1.040 to 1.080 g / mL by using Percoll and PBS-/-. The planarian stem cells concentrated in the upper part in high-density conditions (1.070, 1.080 g / mL), and concentrated in the lower part in low-density conditions (1.040 g / mL). These results suggested that density gradient centrifugation by two layers with a 1.040 g / mL solution (upper layer) and a 1.070 g / mL solution with cells (lower layer) might be a good condition for purifying planarian cells.
As the future plans, purified planarian stem cells will be cultured in a medium supplemented with cell growth factors, and the growth rate will be evaluated."
9,3,Examination of medium for culturing planarian cells ,"Planarian has a high regenerative capacity because pluripotent stem cells are distributed throughout the body, since planarian are good model animal for regeneration research. Althought, the pluripotent stem cells are the key of regeneration, the cells are not successfully cultured and propagated in vitro and the details of the regeneration processes are unknown.
We examined two culture medium to keep planarian cells for the long-term. An isotonic planarian medium (IPM), which was reported to be a good medium for keeping planarian cells, was prepared. We make the medium. As a result, a medium having an osmotic pressure of 125 mmol / kg and a pH of 7.4 was successfully produced, Suggesting.
We will complain possible to reconfirm the usefulness of the isotonic planarian medium (IPM) by comparing the isotonic planarian medium (IPM) and the 40% L-15 medium and performing a reproduction experiment."
9,7,Development of a high-throughput screening method for filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei employing droplet-based microfluidics ,"Filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is well-known as one of the most efficient producers of cellulolytic enzymes in the industry. Recently, the genetic transformation techniques allowed controlling the expression of a various gene of T. reesei, leading to generating cellulase hyper producing strains appropriate for industrial applications. However, these applications were thwarted by several obstacles such as time-consuming and low- throughput screening. Therefore, to overcome the obstacles, we developed a high-throughput screening method employing droplet-based microfluidics and using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a visible marker for droplets. Here, we have proven that the regeneration of T. reesei protoplast in droplets was more efficiency than on agar plates that were widely used in classical transformant methods. By utilizing Fluorescence-Activated Droplets Sorters (FADS) with a screening speed at 6,000 droplets/min, we succeded in high-throughput screening for both fungal spores and protoplasts expressing GFP from a mixture of strains after 3 and 4 days of droplet cultivation, respectively. In the future, we will use the droplets microfluidic platform for sorting rapidly transformants of T. reesei with a high level of GFP expression."
9,11,Crack Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Model And Smoothing Filter ,"Cracks occur on pavements due to aged deterioration, load and weather conditions, and so on.If they will take no measures to deal with something, the risk of road traffic accidents such as vehicle collisions or motorcycle falls would be increased. Moreover, if this situation gets worse, pot holes will occur and the risk will be increased.Therefore, it is important to check and diagnose them properly so that road traffic safety and driving comfort are maintained.However, the crack inspection of pavements is still performed manually, and it is not practical because a dedicated measurement vehicle equipped with a large number of sensors is expensive.Therefore, low cost and efficient pavement inspection systems are required, and various crack detection methods using pavement roads images have been widely studied.
We considered crack detection using pavement images from the field of image segmentation. Clustering is one of the ways to realize image segmentation and one of the typical unsupervised learning.There are k-means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as general clustering, but there is a defect that they are weak to noise. So far, many methods have been studied to realize noise-robust segmentation.However, as with crack detection methods, improving both accuracy and processing time is a major issue.From these things, we focused on both image processing and clustering, and considered ways to solve this problem.
In this paper, we proposed a new crack detection method combining GMM and smoothing filter. By combining the image processing such as smoothing filter instead of the improvement of the clustering method, the processing time can be shortened and the accuracy can be greatly improved compared to the conventional methods. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art crack detection methods in both accuracy and processing time.
Our future work is to further improve the accuracy while maintaining the processing time. In addition, it is necessary to examine changes in the combination of clustering method and image processing and the configuration of processing."
9,4,Hierarchical Score Metric for Ranked Salient Object Detection ,"In this study, we propose novel metrics for ranked salient object detection. Ranked salient object detection is a generalized technique to detect salient objects with hierarchical scores. Unfortunately, there are no existing metrics for ranked salient object detection and therefore these accuracies calculated by F-measure. F-measure is a widespread metric for many image applications and calculate accuracies of object contour estimation. However, it is not suitable for calculating the distance between different saliency scores. Most methods perceptually evaluate accuracies of saliency scores. Our metrics consider both of object contours and saliency scores estimation accuracies using F-measure and mean absolute error (MAE). We combine F-measure scores and MAE scores using a linier combination. F-measure and MAE calculate object contours and saliency scores accuracies, respectively. They are combined by a weight parameter which is calculated by subjective evaluations. Our simulations show that the proposed metrics is more suitable for ranked salient object detection objectively and perceptually."
9,3,Presentation of lateral acceleration with visually induced illusion of self-motion ,"General maneuvering simulators reproduce acceleration by moving their enclosures. Because the cost of employing the moving system tends to be very high, establishment of less costly and more simple substitution method to give acceleration is desirable.
In this study, visually induced illusions of self-motion (vection) is proposed as a low-cost alternative. We investigated whether vection can give the lateral acceleration to the operator through subjective evaluation. Furthermore, we tried to quantify the lateral acceleration which observers feel against the visual stimulus.
From the result of the experiments, which use random dots as visual stimulus, we found that random dots their velocity is 60 [m/s] are observed through a fixed rectangular frame are the optimum to perceive self-motion feeling. However, any quantitative value we used could not uniquely evaluate the degree of the visual stimulus. That means the lateral acceleration can be presented by through vection, but the quantification is difficult due to the lack of reproducibility. In order to improve the reproducibility, it is a future task to define the measurement environment and the experimental conditions more clearly."
9,4,Visualization of Scraping Work using OpenPose ,"In manufacturing of precise surface plates, scraping work is necessary to improve flatness of the surface plates and to reduce frictional resistance of them. Figure 1 is a scene of scraping work. In this work, it is necessary for skillful workers to have long worker experience and intuition of the skill. Because the skillful workers have been aging recently, the skill of the scraping work requires visualization of the skill for bringing up successors efficiently. Therefore, we focus on OpenPose to visualize the scraping work. In this paper, we report overview of OpenPose to be used in this study and future study outlook.
OpenPose is a library which can visualize human postures from the input video or picture, using deep learning. It was developed by Zhe Cao and others from Carnegie Mellon University. Figure 2 shows an example of human posture visualization using OpenPose. From this figure, it can be seen that the library can visualize the human posture by being added links and points on the input video or picture.
In future study, the video which is added links and points by OpenPose will be used to evaluate whether such video was easy to understand for persons who has not experienced scraping work. Furthermore, motion capture system, musculoskeletal analysis software, force plates, pressure distribution measuring system and load cell will be used as well as OpenPose to visualize scraping work more."
9,4,Ultimate Bearing Capacity of Rigid Footing on Sandy Soils for Eccentrically Inclined Load ,"In geotechnical engineering, the stability of a rigid footing under an eccentrically inclined load is an
important issue. This is because the number of superstructure building has increased and the situation of
structures being subjected to eccentrically inclined loading is occurring more and more frequently. The
objective of this paper is to evaluate the bearing capacity of rigid footing on the free surface of sandy soil
under the action of eccentric and inclined loads using finite element analysis and assuming that the soil
follows the Drucker-Prager’s yield function. In two-dimensional analysis of the footing-soil system, the
rigid plastic finite element method (RPFEM) was applied to calculate the ultimate bearing capacity of
footing. In computation, an interface element was introduced to simulate the footing-soil system with
newly developing the rigid plastic constitutive equation. The footing is considered to be rigid and rough,
as it most often is in reality. This study investigated the effect of the internal friction angle of the soil on
the load inclination factor iγ and the failure envelope in V-H plane. The results are used to determine value
of inclination factor iγ in order to investigate the validity of current design methods. Moreover, the effect
of the direction of the horizontal load on the failure envelope in V-H-M space was clarified. Through a
series of numerical analyses, new equations are proposed for the load inclination factor iγ, and the limit
load space in the normalized vertical load of V/Vult and the normalized horizontal load of H/Vult on sandy
soils, where Vult is the ultimate bearing capacity of the centric vertical load. The obtained limit load space

9,11,EVALUATION OF DIRECTIONALITY CONSIDERING PERIODIC CHARACTERISTICS FOR STRONG MOTION OBSERVATION RECORDS ,"In this study, in order to establish seismic performance evaluation method induced by horizontal bi-directional input, it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of actual bi-directional ground motions in detail. The directionality of bi-directional response considering periodic characteristics of ground motions was examined based on observation records of strong motion in Japan. First, as measure of seismic intensity from two horizontal components of seismic ground motion, focus on RotD100, 50 and 00[1] which takes the maximum, median and minimum values which have different response direction due to bi-directional input. In addition, an omnidirectional display based on bi-axial response spectrum[2] is proposed in which the relationship between the intensity, directionality, and natural period of the seismic response is visualized using polar coordinates and a color map. Next, the average of RotD100, 50, 00 and omnidirectional display based on bi-axial response spectrum is calculated in order to clarify the characteristics of the directionality considering the periodic characteristics of the bi-directional ground motion for the typical strong inland earthquakes and subduction zone earthquakes in Japan.
As result, it is confirmed that there is a difference in directionality between inland earthquakes and subduction zone earthquakes."
9,11,Calculation of Bearing Capacity of Spread Foundation by Rigid Plastic Finite Element Method ,"It is important to calculate of the bearing capacity of the ground to design buildings. Currently, the calculation formula for the vertical bearing capacity of spread foundation is specified in the guideline published by Architectural Institute of Japan for the design of building foundations. By using this calculation formula, we are examining various bearing capacities. However, these bearing capacity formulas are semi-empirical ones which are proposed based on experiments and theoretical considerations. The accuracy of the bearing capacity formula is unknown, and the applicability to practice is still unclear. Firstly, in this study, the bearing capacity for vertical load is examined using the rigid plastic finite element method (RPFEM). This method is a numerical analysis method applied to the field of geotechnical engineering by Tamura[1] and Ohtsuka[2] et al. The special characteristic of this method is to employ a few strength parameters. It
   uses only cohesion, c and internal friction angle, 𝜑 as the strength parameters in order to directly process the limit state by ignoring the deformation of the building and the ground. In regard to the bearing capacity for vertical load, through a series of rigid plastic finite element analysis, the comparison of ultimate bearing capacities of spread foundation between the analysis results and the formula of Architectural Institute of Japan is conducted to confirm the consistency as shown in Fig.1. After that, using the same method as the bearing capacity for vertical load, the examination of the ultimate bearing capacity for complex loads such as horizontal load and eccentric load that occur when seismic force is applied, is carried out."
9,13, Exploring Possibilities of Education by collaborative creative activities in Hult Prize at Nagaoka University of Technology,"As a consequence of Earth Day, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and other related initiatives, environmental consciousness globally is arguably greater than it has ever been. However, the natural environment itself continues to be degraded at a massive scale by human economic activity. Our challenge is to replace every industry on the planet with future better versions. We will start by becoming a member of the world's largest social entrepreneurial platform called the Hult Prize to building bold businesses that will improve our planet with every sale. 
Currently we are working to hold “Hult Prize” at Nagaoka University of Technology. Hult Prize is the world’s largest social entrepreneur platform for solving global social problems using business. Every year, over 1 million students participate it and create ides to solve the social problems. The best idea is given million dollars (about 100 million yen) to accelerate commercialization. So, Hult Prize called “The student of Nobel Peace Prize.”  Base on the theme related to SDGs, a team of 3 to 4 people will present business ideas in English for 10 minutes, and the judges will select the best team. The greatest feature of Hult Prize is the curriculum support students throughout the year. Hult Prize has 4 contests to select the best team. First contests, “On Campus Program” is held at each university. The winner team is next contests “Regionals”. And next is “Accelerator”, the final is “Global Final”. The contests we are able to hold is “On Campus Program”.
Hult Prize has a deep connection to SDGs. There is a report called “The Limit of Growth’s” which is the beginning why SDGs make. This report showed that if we keep increasing the population and growing economy as it is, we are going to decline until 2030[1]. SDGs made to avoid this scenario. So, we must change the world to grow human permanently with SDGs. But it is impossible to keep doing the actions to achieve SDGs without money. It is necessary to connect business with SDGs.

9,11,Technology development for aerosol fire-extinguishing system ,"
We have developed aerosol fire-extinguishing system ""K/SMOKE"". K/SMOKE emits fire extinguishing agents as smoke/aerosol, and suppresses combustion by chemical reaction. The mechanism to suppress fire using aerosols is as follows1), 2): first, free radicals are formed, and fires propagate by a chain reaction of free radicals such as hydrogen, oxygen, and hydroxyl radicals. After heat decomposition, an aerosol generator forms potassium radicals and ions as “K” and these attack the free radicals in fire, leading to complete fire suppression and stabilization.
We have succeeded in the first domestic production of an aerosol fire extinguishing system. Currently, there are 2 lineup, electrically operated system and non-electrically operated device. In addition, in consideration of the fire extinguishing systems for fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen stations, we have been working to develop technology for fire extinguishing of Hydrogen flame with the aerosol fire extinguishing systems."

9,7,Development of repair technology for CFRTP delamination by a four-dimensional pinpoint eddy current method ,"Products molded by carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) are used in automobile bodies and aircraft bodies. Practical development of three-dimensional (3D) CFRTP peeling repair is expected beyond existing two-dimensional (2D) CFRTP peeling repair. We change the excitation frequency and the excitation time of the coil after matching its shape and size to 3D CFRTP. CFRTP can be melted to obtain its complex shape by applying four-dimensional pinpoint eddy current of length, width, depth, and time to CFRTP. We quantitatively show that this eddy current method can be used to repair peeling of CFRTP and to obtain sufficient strength for practical use, and we elucidate the melting mechanism and clarify the optimum fusing conditions during peeling repair. A 3D CFRTP was manufactured using an electric injection molding machine (Toshiba EC100SXII-2A). First, in accordance with JIS K 7089, a simple ball drop impact tester was manufactured to drop steel balls under various conditions. The surface and inside of the CFRTP were confirmed by eddy current testing and X-ray computed tomography (CT) (Fig.1). When the energy of free fall was 10.2 J, delamination (0.02 mm) inside the CFRTP could be confirmed by X-ray CT inspection. Second, the CFRTP was damaged by induction heating using a square coil, and then melted and fused by a Newton press. The CFRTP surface was observed by changing the induction heating time to 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s, and 150 s. As a result of heating for 150 s, the maximum temperature was 342°C indicating that the CFRTP was successfully heated above its melting point (Fig.2). This method made it possible to locally heat and melt the 3D CFRTP. However, tensile strength of the test piece decreased after fusion Therefore, further examination of these heating conditions and fusing conditions is necessary."

11,9,Effect of the 355-nm laser irradiation to the TiO2 photocatalysts on the OH-radical formation,"It is well known that TiO2 is famous for the solar energy conversion material as well as the environmental cleaning effects. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of laser irradiation to the various TiO2 powders It was found that 355-nm laser irradiation to the TiO2 powders changed the color of TiO2 powders from white to black, due to the generation of oxygen vacancies of TiO2 crystal structures. We have also investigated the effect of the amount of OH radical formation for both of TiO2 powders with and without laser irradiation and it was confirmed that 30-min laser irradiation increases the OH radical formation. On the other hand, no enhancement of OH-radical formation was found on the visible light irradiation to laser-irradiated black TiO2 powders. In the conference we will present these results and will also discuss the mechanism."
11,13,Effect of repair with pulse current sintering and fine particle on fatigue life and crack growth rate ,"In recent years, aging of large structures such as bridges has become a problem. Therefore, a simple pro-longing fatigue life method has been demanded. In this study, the effect of our repair method(1) using fine particles and pulsed current sintering was clarified on fatigue test with the specimens having simulated cracks.
The test material was S45C annealed material. The specimen has a simulated crack. After the simulated crack was filled with fine particles, pulse sintering was performed. A test piece treated with pulse energization is called ""heat treatment specimen"". A test piece energized after filling with particles is referred to as “repair specimen"". A test piece without pulse sintering and repaire is called ""non-treated specimen"". The specimen surface was polished to #1500. After polishing, a fatigue test was performed with a maximum load of 17,000 N, a frequency of 0.7 Hz, and a stress ratio R=0.05.
Number of failures on non-treated specimen, heat treatment specimen and repair specimen are 3898, 3531 and 4679, respectively. This result indicates that heat treatment decreases fatigue life and our repair method increase fatigue life. Figure 1 shows a relationship between crack growth rate and number of cycle. As shown in Fig. 1, on all specimen, a crack initiated from 500 to 1000 cycle. At 2000 cycle, crack growth rate of the heat treatment specimen is 2 times higher than other specimens. At 3000 cycle, crack growth rate of the repair specimen is half of the rate of the non-treated specimen. These results suggested that sintered layer suppressed fatigue crack propagation."
11,12,Chitin Hydrogel Fibers prepared through Wet-spinning Process ,"In order to prepare Chitin fibers, Chitin purified from crab-shell waste was dissolved in N, N-dimethyl acetamine/ 5 wt% lithium chloride (DMAc/ 5 wt% LiCl) at room temperature in 1, 1.5 and 2 wt% of concentrations. Chitin hydrogel fibers were prepared by phase inversion using wet-spinning process (Fig. 1) at different temperature of the water coagulation bath in the range of 5 - 60oC. As the results, Chitin fibers were successfully obtained in the water coagulation bath. The SEM results suggested that denser structure of the chitin hydrogel fiber was observed when the temperature of the coagulation bath increased (Fig. 2). The resultant chitin hydrogel fibers prepared at higher temperature of water bath showed the increment in term of elastic and mechanical properties. At the 2 wt% of the chitin solution in DMAc, at 60oC, the tensile strength of the fiber obtained to be 182 MPa relative to that of 5oC. The elastic modulus was enhanced, while the equilibrium water content in the fiber significantly decreased from 1101 to 335 %. The deconvolution of FT-IR spectra indicated that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding NH...OC increased, whereas the reduction in the intra-interaction was confirmed at higher temperature, maybe contributing to the strength influencing on the temperature change."
11,13,Statistical Mechanics of Environmental Prediction Using Thermal Index ,"Previously, we have studied a system for predicting environments and power consumption of air conditioner
(1)
based on the Bayesian iterative method
systems, we construct a method of environmental prediction using thermal index based on analogy of the Bayesian inference and statistical mechanics due to the mean-field theory (MFT) for the full-connected Q-Ising model in Fig. 1. In this method, we estimate environmental variables as expectations averaged over the posterior at each sampling point. As shown in Fig. 2, the MFT finds that optimum of the temperature-humidity index (THI) is realized, if we have perfect knowledges on the assumed true prior and the assumed transition probability from each original state to the observed one, and that the THI becomes larger (smaller) than the optimum with a decrease (increase) in the parameter of temperature difference. Also, we find that the robustness of our system is improved by introducing the model prior enhancing the optimum of the THI into the system."
11,9,Study on Riverbed Variation Management by Various Groin at a River Confluence Associated with the Barrage Water ,"The Kakogawa River which has a catchment area of 1,730km2 and a length of 96.0km, flows through Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. The influence of runoff due to barrage water and the Mino River tributary, combined with a meander in the river upstream from the large barrage on the Kakogawa River (Kakogawa Barrage), has promoted the development of the sandbars on the river bank opposite the confluence. The sandbars, which has enlarged and become fixed, currently deflects the passage of water back to the left bank and has decreased the usable water surface area of the river. To wash away the sandbar, the groin was installed in 2015(Figure 1). The purpose of this study was to survey the river topography in the vicinity of the Mino River confluence and identify the factors responsible for sandbar development by using model experiments and numerical analysis. In addition, we verify the function of the groin and the effects caused by changing the characteristics of the groin. The model experiments were carried out in an 8m long, 0.8m width, and 0.4m depth rectangular main channel under the movable bed condition, in which a 0.48m width tributary channel joined in a right angle at 4.33m downstream from the upstream of main channel (Figure 2). Movable-bed modeling of the channels at the tributary junction was performed to assess the influence of the barrage water and the river meander upstream on river flow, and to observe the flow and the change of elevation characteristics at the junction and their influence on river topography. The numerical analysis were analyzed using the two-dimensional flow analysis software, Nays2DH (iRIC, 2014) to verify the experimental results and to investigate how they can be applied."
11,15,Indoor Experiment for Development of Permeability Test Equipment for High Water Permeability Ground ,"In laying down the drain layer of a river bank, designing a liquefaction countermeasure work, and calculating the drainage amount of the root-cutting retainer, accurate values of permeability k = 10-3 to 10-4 m/s are necessary become. However, the in-situ permeability test apparatus currently developed can only measure up to about a permeability coefficient of about 10-5 m/s. Therefore, in order to expand the applicable range, the permeability test device for high water permeability has been improved. In this research, we conducted experiments to verify the followability of the water injection volume to maintain constant water level using this equipment, and carried out
water permeation test of highly permeable material which has not been done so far, report it compiled."
11,9,Experimental study on carbon fiber sheet bonding method to steel member with residual deformation ,"In recent years, social infrastructure such as bridges has become dangerous due to aging. Focusing on steel bridges, it has problem that deformation of members due to fire when repairing work was carried out. The conventional method for repairing the deformation member in the steel girder bridge are heat-straightening and replacement of members. However, the new method has been required because these have inefficient work. In this study, we examine the applicability of carbon fiber sheet bonding to the deformation of members due to fire. We carried out the uniaxial compression test to investigation the strength and deformation characteristics for CFRP bonding steel plate. As a result, it was confirmed that the repairing method using carbon fiber sheet recovered the strength. Also, it was confirmed that the decreasing of strength when the increasing the value(δ/l) that is residual deformation(δ) divided by the specimen length(l)."
11,3,A Method for visualizing the Long Term Transition of Population Density Structure in Local Cities ,"The policy for realization of compact city is promoted by local cities in Japan because their current urban forms will not be adapted to the drastic population decrease and aging. Since the technology of Geographic Information System (GIS) spread in fields of statistics, it has become easier for anyone to check the current population density that provides an indication of how the city is not compact. However, there was very limited methods to analyze the population density in the period of time during which GIS was not used for National Census and the suburban sprawl was not proceeding, such as 1970.
Therefore, we developed a method for visualizing the long term transition of population density structure at Densely Inhabited District (DID: District with a population density of about 40 people or more per hectare and a total population exceeding 5,000) based on the documents of census enumeration districts. Then, we apply the method to 3 local cities (Nagaoka, Kanazawa, and Matsumoto) at the three periods of time, 1970, 1990, and 2015, and analyze the relationship between the population density, zoning areas, and current land uses with GIS.
As a result, the density at 1970 DID has declined due to the shift of smaller household and the land use transition. By contrast, 1990 DID outside 1970 DID has increased the rate of developed land because there is a large residential area where the land use is controlled with exclusive zoning policy. 2015 DID outside 1990 DID may be developed similarly on account of including farmlands.
For the realization of compact urban structure in these cities, we propose that the municipalities should check and control the urbanization at 2015 DID outside 1990 DID."
11,9,Research on the Electric Wire Discharge Crush Method and Crack Control for Concrete Structure ,"Currently, as a method for crushing concrete or bedrock, gunpowder has been widely used. However, non- gunpowder blasting method is strongly requested because of the safety and the low environmental influence.
In this research, we conducted a study on the shock crushing method by discharge, especially to realize crack control in a crushed object. A small mortar piece with a wedge-shaped cavity(Fig.1) was used for controlling the cracks. Electrodes that were connected with a thin aluminum wire were inserted in it. A large test piece with a hole, the size of 245 mm(length) x 181 mm(width) x 75 mm(depth), was used as a crushed object and the small mortar piece is embedded in it(Fig.2).
In the experiment, a large current with short period flowed through the electrodes and the thin aluminum wire was vaporized instantaneously then the large mortar piece was fractured along the wedge-shaped cavity of the small piece(Photo.1).
As a result of the experiment, the crack of the large mortar test piece can be controlled by this method."
11,9,Study on the Position of Recently Urbanization Land Use out of City Planning Area in Municipal Urban Master Plan ,"The purpose of this research is clarified how to manage the urbanization land use out of City Planning Area by Municipal Urban Master Plan.
As a result of the analysis by Municipal Urban Master Plan, 82 municipalities accept the urbanization land use out of City Planning Area. Only 14 out of 82 Municipal Urban Master Plan indicated land use regulation and laws other than City Planning Act. In addition, 37 out of 82 municipalities don‘t have the clear fact of the urbanization land use and accept not only commercial or industrial land use but also residence one. Such municipalities have the possible to cause disorderly development.
As a result of the judgement by air photograph for extracting small scale development and village, 11 out of 37 municipalities accept large scale development from 1980 through 2000. These municipalities are target of this research.
We conducted field survey in Yonago and Shimada city out of 11municipalities to research the actual condition of land use management. Yonago city consider to admit the district which accept urbanization land use into City Planning Area. However, residential area which have many vacant houses and new develop area are confirmed. Therefore, it is skeptical whether land use regulation functions. Shimada city also developed residential area and villa in spite of establishing laws other than City Planning Act[photo].
As a result, many municipalities don‘t secure manage urbanization land use out of City Planning Area. On the other hand, land use management is not enough actually even though Municipal Urban Master Plan indicated land use regulation and laws other than City Planning Act."
11,9,Development of High-frequency Inverter for Wireless Power Transfer System ,"Wireless power transfer (WPT) system is one of the energy supplying technology without connecting any cables. In recent years, WPT is expected to apply the charging system for Electronic Vehicle (EV). A charging system for EV is required to reduce the time of charging, so high power conversion circuit is necessary. However, the volume of the high power conversion circuit is large and the weight is heavy. Especially, WPT system using coil with ferrite core to transfer power. Ferrite core is one of the heavy component.
The circuit volume and weight can be reduced by increasing switching frequency. However, the effect of the parasitic parameter cannot be ignored as switching frequency is increasing. Therefore, accurate analysis and measurement of parasitic parameters in a prototype circuit are necessary to reflect them in the main circuit design.
In this study, the analysis and measurement method of the parasitic parameter is discussed. The characteristic of the high- frequency circuit is described by S-parameter. Therefore the way to analyze parasitic parameters using S-parameter is investigated. Finally, we have the waveform at FET in the simulation to confirm the accuracy of the analysis result."

12,11,Study on Public Building Complex in Housing Estates Developed by Public Organization in Aichi Prefecture ,"Some housing estates developed during Showa period are getting decrepit and need to be repaired(Photo1). According to MLIT(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism), housing estates are fortune because there are a lot of public facilities. The facilities should be preserved to leave the housing estates.
This research focuses on Public Building Complex(PBC). The management of them is easier than facilities which have single function(Fig.1).
In Aichi, there are 26 housing estates developed by public organization during Showa period and 12 PBC in the housing estates. 9 PBC have more than 2 functions, 6 PBC have transmitted functions, and 6 PBC are managed by private companies(Photo2). In addition, 6 PBC aren’t written about management plans in Public Facilities Comprehensive Management Plan(PMCMP). Therefore, their management plans aren’t established and considered."
12,9,Investigation of micro bubbles made by homogenizer for flotation ,"Flotation is a method of separating and recovering only the necessary mineral particles which grinded mineral ores from the mine by bubbles in the solution.
The demand for minerals that can be recovered by the flotation method is increasing year by year, and the price of materials is rising. In the past, ores which could be taken in the dry zone was difficult to recover due to the high cost of transporting. Recently, new ore exploration began in Chile and Australia to develop as mines because of rising of mineral prices.
Flotation is necessary to manage the flow line and flow rate. It would be happened overflow and stop the operation of the facility. If the feed amount is insufficient, the recovery rate of minerals will be decreased and it will not be possible to obtain sufficient revenue. For this reason, development of a beneficiation device that can simplify the flow control of the facility is eagerly desired.
For this reason, we developed a flotation technology that reduces the flow lines and facilitate flow control to improve the recovery rate. In addition, use it in mines where it is difficult to use a large amount of water in dry areas. In order to simplify the management of the flow line, in this study, we come up with device did not use solution to make bubble[1] and inspected micro bubble size[2] made by homogenizer and relation with MIBC."
13,9,Significant texture weakening and enhancing room-temperature stretch formability of Mg-Al alloy sheet via micro-alloying ,"One way to reduce greenhouse gas emission from transportation vehicles such as automobiles, trains, and aircrafts is to improve fuel efficiency. Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest metal material among structural metal materials such as steel and aluminum (Al), so we can expect weight reduction by using Mg alloys as automotive body panels. However, typical wrought Mg alloy sheets such as Mg-Al-Mn (AM-series) and Mg-Al-Zn (AZ-series) alloy sheets exhibit poor room-temperature formability due to the formation of strong basal texture during the rolling processing [1]. This hinders practical application of Mg alloy sheets in automotive industries.
Therefore, weakening of the basal texture is necessary. The texture feature in rolled Mg alloy sheets is strongly influenced by the alloy composition, rolling process, and heat treatment. In this study, we have investigated the effect of Zn and Ca additions on grain structure, texture, and mechanical properties of a commercial Mg-3Al- 0.4Mn (mass%) alloy sheet with the aim of weakening basal texture. By adding Zn and Ca, we have successfully obtained a weakened basal texture, resulting in a good Erichsen value of ~ 7 mm and a moderate 0.2 % proof stress of 150 MPa in a Mg-3Al-0.7Ca-0.7Zn-0.4Mn (mass%) alloy sheet. Also, we have clarified the texture weakening mechanism using an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The results will shed light on the nature of weak basal texture, and provide process-microstructure relationship of Mg alloy sheets."
13,9,Compositional optimization of dilute Mg-Al-Ca-Mn alloy with high strengths ,"Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest commercial metal material and thus wrought Mg alloys have great potential as lightweight structural materials in automotive industries. However, there are few applications of wrought Mg alloys in the transportation vehicles due to their poor hot-workability and mechanical properties compared to aluminum (Al) alloys and steels.
To overcome these problems, we have developed a dilute Mg-1.3Al-0.3Ca-0.4Mn (wt.%) alloy [1]. The particular alloy can be extruded at a die-exit speed of 24 m/min, which is comparable to Al-Mg-Si based 6xxx Al alloys. Also, the newly developed Mg-Al-Ca-Mn alloy exhibits high 0.2 % proof stress of 287MPa after a T6-treatment (solution treatment + aging). This high strength is attributed to its fine grain of ~20μm and finely dispersed plate- shaped Guinier Preston zones lying on the (0001) planes. However, further compositional optimization will be required for improving age-hardening response and mechanical properties of dilute Mg-Al-Ca-Mn alloys.
This work aims at developing dilute Mg-Al-Ca-Mn alloys which can be substantially strengthened by a aging via compositional optimization of Al, Ca, and Mn.
Fig. 1 (a) shows age-hardening response at 170 °C of Mg-xAl-0.5Ca-0.2Mn(wt.%, x=0.7, 1.3, and1.6) alloys extruded at 400 °C and solution-treated at 500 °C for 1 hr. The age-hardening response after a cold-rolling with a rolling reduction of 6 % is also shown in the Fig. 1 (b) to evaluate the bake-hardenability. The Vickers hardness of the as-solution-treated samples gradually increases with increasing the aging time, and all samples reach their peak hardness after the aging over 4 hr. The hardness increments in all samples are almost the same, ~16 HV. After the cold-rolling, the hardness increases to ~65 HV, and all samples reach their peak hardness by the aging for only 40 min. Also, the hardness of all samples increases ~10 HV even after the short-time aging for 20min, suggesting that the alloy will become promising materials as paint baking Mg alloys."
13,7,Verification of Current Model Using Transconductance ,"1. Introduction
It has been confirmed that current imbalances cause current oscillations when semiconductor switches are
connected in parallel[1]. The current oscillation cannot be ignored from the viewpoint of noise and safe operation. Therefore, previous researches have focused on current imbalance and have proposed a current model considering transconductance. In this report, we verify the validity of the current model at turn-off when a SiC MOSFET is operated in single and parallel is verified.
    2. The current model applied transconductance
Fig. 1 shows half bridge circuit with high side paralleled switches. In the
case of the single operation, Q2 is removed and verified. Transconductance is defined as gfs id Vgs [S]. By regarding reciprocal of transconductance as the resistance, we can simulate the effect of transconductance. In addition, as the value of transconductance depend on the gate voltage, this resistance is treated as a variable resistance.
Fig.1 Half bridge circuit
 Fig. 2 and 3 show the current model verification results for single and parallel operations when the switch is turned off. From these figures, there is a difference of the falling time both in single and parallel, but the turn-off operation can be reproduced. Therefore, it can be said that a current model using transconductance is effective. Fig.2 Model verification under single operation Fig.3 Model verification under parallel operation 3. Conclusion
In this study, it was shown that a valid current model can be constructed by treating the transconductance as a variable resistance. In the future, we will derive a current formula using transconductance to improve the accuracy of the simulation. This research was supported by NUT grant for collaborative research with NIT."
13,9,LIVING ENVIRONMENT IN THE SEA OF JAPAN SIDE AND SDGs ,"Hybrid Passive House contributes to CO2 reduction and health of residents
by living comfortably and conserving use (durability). Current Issues
Currently, Japan's CO2 reduction status is an increasing trend with the amount of CO2 emitted by the household sector (air conditioning, etc.).
Nagaoka City has only one-third sunshine hours on the Pacific side in winter. On the contrary, there is a lot of snow and in summer, the sun is about 1.3 times longer than the Pacific side, and it is hot and humid. This increases the amount of energy required for air conditioning and heating, and thus increases costs.

14,12,Solidification of Oil-in-water by using In-liquid Plasma Treatment ,"Marine transportation such as merchant vessel is inevitable for our modern society. Most vessels work consuming fuel oil and lubricating oil, which are strictly managed in vessel to prevent oil leak to sea. In vessel, oil-containing water are separated to waste oil and waste water. However, emulsifying oil which is generated by containing surfactants is required additional treatment. There is the potential risk of marine pollution by leaking oil because the oils are stored in liquid state.
In this study, I focused on solidification of oils by using in-liquid plasma treatment. In-liquid plasma [1] is one of an atmospheric pressure plasma generated in liquid such as water. Plasmas has generally high temperature such as thousands Kelvin and various reactive group such as hydroxyl group and oxygen radical. Therefore, the plasma reacts oil in water and decomposed oil into solidified carbon and hydrogen gas [2].
In my experimental device, the in-liquid plasma is generated in bubbles of argon (Ar) in water or water solution
as shown in figure 1. The experimental device had a high-voltage pulse power source (Wave length: 10 μs, Voltage:
  < 10 kV, Frequency: 10 kHz), facing stick electrodeガs. Aスdisc排harg気e occurred between electrodes in an Ar bubble -1
and then the plasma generated. The Ar gas was injected to a reactor tube with flow rate of 1 L min . In the preliminary experiment, decane of alkane was used as simulation of oils for vessel. Plasma emissions were observed by using a spectrometer (Wavelength: 200–1100 nm, Resolution: 0.6–0.7 nm). After for plasma reaction, the decane-containing water was suspended and residue was obtained by filtering. The in-liquid plasma solidified oil like matter in water.
In the conference, I will explain more detail of the experiment and results about the oil solidification experiments."
14,6,Water Purification with Biological Nitrification and Denitrification ,"When a living body is kept in a water tank, toxic ammonium ions generates from the feces and remainder of the food. If ammonium ions are accumulated, it adversely affects the living body. Therefore, water purification system to remove ammonium ions is necessary. Biological nitrification and denitrification system is a way of biofiltration by multiple kinds of bacteria [1]. This filtration system doesn’t need to change the water. Moreover, this is clean system because nitrogen components in the water tank are finally emitted as nitrogen gas. In this study, filtration performance of biological nitrification and denitrification system was demonstrated.
A seawater tank and a freshwater tank were prepared for the examination. Spot prawns were kept in seawater tank kept at 9 °C. A flounder was raised in a seawater tank until May (approximately 170 days). On the other hand, sturgeons were kept in a freshwater tank kept at 15 °C. The nitrification tanks using DHS (down-flow hanging sponge) reactor were placed to each water tanks. The denitrification tanks apply USB (up-flow sludge blanket) system. The concentration of ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were quantitated periodically in order to examine the biofiltration by bacteria.
Figure1 shows the transition of concentration of nitrogen components in the seawater tank. The concentration of ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen have been kept under 1.0 mg/L. Moreover, the concentration of nitrate nitrogen fell below the target value of 7.0 mg/L. Figure2 shows nitrogen concentration in fesh water tank. Nitrogen concentration has been decreasing since the 50th day. Therefore, Bacteria in charge of nitrification and denitrification are functioning in seawater (9°C) and freshwater (15 °C)."
14,9,Development of newly Aquaculture Technology By Fibrous Filter ,"Food security and water reservation are urgent because the world population is growing. Among fish food source for example in fish and shell fish, Seafood is important to take protein on our daily life. In fact, the global consumption of fish and shellfish has increased about five times over the past half century due to the population growing. However, fish stocks for which we can use sustainably tend to reduce. So people need to keep production of seafood by using way to save fish stocks. We are proposing aquaculture technology using water reservation materials in fish land culture. As seen in pictures of aquaculture farm for fish on land, the water making technology uses fibrous filter, K2AQUA, to save fish stocks and to protect sea water for fish feed. In the present work, we introduce development of to be grown up fish by new bio-filter for improvement of water quality. Kasai Co. has developed aquaculture technique by cooperative investigation with NUT Kobayashi Lab last for about ten years. The fibrous filter, K2AQUA, was developed for decontamination water of radioactive cesium in Fukushima [1] and now this is applying for a bio-filter that can be used to aquaculture system, since the product is possible to eliminate ammonium in the fish culture water with high efficiency. In addition, the K2AQUA fibers become good medium matrix in the porous space which can concentrate ammonia to convert biologically the ammonia to nitrate. We noted that the porous structure inside of the fiber is suitable for cultivation of bacteria to keep clean the water for long time periods. In addition, the operation is quietly simple to maintain the water quality by putting them in the aquaculture system because the filter enables .providing good environment of microorganism cultivation in the highly concentrated ammonium medium in the porous structure. We report that the K2AQUA filter can be used for a long period cultivation of fish and provide in the oxidative decomposition of the ammonium in the filter environment."
15,12,Development of Novel Ethylene Gas Removing Packaging Sheet by Using Plant Based Chemicals ,"Ethylene gas from fruit is one of the most serious problems in export and import business. This is because ethylene gas is a kind of growth hormone of fruit and can promote the aging. Therefore, the material capturing ethylene gas is increasingly alternative in the industrial field, because of importance in keeping the freshness of perishable food during the transportation with extremely huge amounts. At present, the most widely used technology for capturing ethylene gas for perishable food is physisorption on porous materials such as activated carbon and zeolite however the development of more effective adsorbent is needed. In the present work, we propose calix[4]resorcinarene, is a cyclic molecule and is one of the famous hosts for hydrophobic molecules and heavy-metal guests for application of ethylene gas adsorbers. Especially, because there is no such ethylene gas adsorbent by organic material, we tried to prepare the calix[4]resorcinarene composite membrane and the behavior of ethylene gas adsorption of its was investigated.
Calix[4]resorcinarene host guest membranes were prepared with hybridization of calix[4]resorcinarene and poly(ethersulfone) (PES) by the phase inversion process. Herein, the calix[4]resorcinarene, was successfully synthesized from resorcinol and plant based aldehyde having a chemical structure of isolated lignin. As a result of gas adsorption experiment, it was confirmed that the ethylene gas adsorption volume per unit area of the calix[4]resorcinarene prepared from syringaldehyde was 3.9 cm3/m2 and was 28 times higher than that of zeolite. Therefore, for preparing the calix[4]resorcinarene composite membrane, the phase inversion process was carried out in phase change of the solution of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone containing both PES and the calix[4]resorcinarene to solid membrane in water coagulation. The composite membranes having different loading amounts of the calix[4]resorcinarene were prepared with 10, 25 and 50 wt% loading. The observation of SEM pictures indicated porous morphology in the PES scaffold. The porous morphology in the cross section of the membrane caused high water content in the range of 371 375 %, meaning easy accessibility of aqueous solution in the membrane. The ability of calix[4]resorcinarene composite membrane as an adsorbent of ethylene gas were confirmed by gas adsorption experiment, showing that the ethylene gas was effectively adsorbed by these membrane, particularly in the case of calix[4]resorcinarene having methoxy group was composited. In conclusion, comparative investigations revealed that the calix[4]resorcinarene having methoxy group showed a higher adsorption capacity towards ethylene gas. Since the ethylene gas adsorption amount were decreased when the calix[4]resorcinarene introduced in the membrane, it would be expected that the development of a composite membrane with A modified on the surface of the membrane is required."
15,11,Washing Effect of High-Power Ultrasound on Decontamination of Arsenic-Polluted Soil,"oil treatment and sonochemistry
Among the environmental pollution problems, arsenic (As) is highly toxic as the contamination rather than any other pollutant heavy metals. Since cleaning process of As polluted soil is adverse in impacts for human health and environment pollutant, the development of the efficient removal of As in soil is urgently required. For As removal technologies, ultrasound (US) is concerned with green and energy technology that minimizes the use of chemicals by the US effect). In the present study, effective removal of As from polluted soil harvested in Japan was studied by using high power US washing at 28 kHz. The US soil washing with 1200 W output power of the US was carried out with several critical experimental parameters. These parameters in US washing process were exposed US powers, exposed times and acid/base additives and those were systematically varied for the decontamination to the polluted soil. It was noted that the exposed US power (1200W) was effective to release As from the soil to the solution. When chemical was added to the US washing process, HCI was better additive at 2 M concentration in the highest efficiency. The resulting data showed that the As elution became to saturate at 1.8 ppm for the US 1200W in 1 hour."
15,9,Isolation of the Plant Growth Promoting Metabolites Produced by Streptomycetes ,"We aim to elucidate the mechanism of symbiosis between plants and actinomycetes by identifying metabolites of actinomycetes that have plant growth promoting effects. We screened for plant growth promoting actinomycetes from plant rhizosphere and field soil. We have found two candidate actinomycete strains by co-culturing method using two-layered agar medium for Arabidopsis thaliana and actinomycetes. One of the strains 1-11 produced unknown plant growth promoting metabolite on the two-layered agar plate. It was confirmed that the plant growth promoting metabolite of 1-11 strain is not a volatile substance. The strain showed 98% similarity to Streptomyces hygroscopicus by 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis, indicating that 1-11 strain is a genus Streptomyces. The purpose of this study is to isolate and characterize the plant growth promoting metabolites from 1-11 strain.
The strain 1-11 was cultured both in GYM liquid medium and on the two-layered agar medium. GYM liquid medium is contained glucose, yeast extract, malt extract and trace elements. The two-layered agar medium is constructed using yeast extract and starch (YS) for bacteria and murashige and skoog (MS) for plant culture. The extracellular metabolites were extracted from the culture broth and agar medium using ethyl acetate. The extract was soaked into a paper disc and dried to remove the solvent. The paper disc was placed at the center of MS agar, which is an agar medium for plant growth, and seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were inoculated around the disk. Plant growth promoting effect was evaluated by comparing the dry weight of Arabidopsis after 3 weeks culture. Whole genome sequence of 1-11 strain was determined using Illumina NovaSeq 600. The secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters of 1-11 strain were predicted using AntiSMASH 5.0.0.
The metabolites extract of GYM broth after cultivation of 1-11 strain was not presented the plant growth promoting activity as an indicator of Arabidopsis thaliana growth. This result indicates that the 1-11 strain can not synthesize the plant growth promoting metabolites in the GYM medium or liquid culture condition. The metabolites extract of the two-layered agar after cultivation of 1-11 strain showed the plant growth promoting activity as an indicator of Arabidopsis thaliana growth (Fig. 1). This result indicates that the 1-11 strain can synthesize the plant growth promoting metabolites on the two-layered agar medium. As a result of the genome sequence analysis of 1-11, the existence of siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster was suggested by the prediction of AntiSMASH 5.0.0."
15,13,Deduction of the Developmental Process of Clonal Plant Populations by Comparing the Methylation Pattern of Genomic DNA of Each Functional Individuals.,"Clonal plants are dominant in various ecosystems including tundras and some clonal plant species are thought to have survived major climate change.Therefore, it is important to clarify the developmental process of clonal plant populations in order to predict ecosystem responses to future climate change.Since the genetic individuals of the clonal plant (a genet) are composed of many functional individuals (ramets), the development of the clonal plant population is nothing but the developmental process of the genet. We propose to compare the methylation pattern of genomic DNA in ramets as a way to deduce the developmental process of clonal plant without long- term survey.
As a research material, we chose Ardisia japonica an evergreen clonal shrub (Fig.1). We set the study site in the deciduous secondary forest dominate by Quercus serrata. We examined genotypes of each ramets by AFLP (Amplified fragments length polyphorphism) method and found that there were at least 5 genets which contain several ramets in the 1 x 1 m2 plot (Fig.1). The CG and CHG methylation in genomic DNA of ramets was analyzed by modified AFLP using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (MS-AFLP). In the study site, we dug up several ramets connected by rhizomes. We examine the changes in DNA methylation pattern with development of a genet."
15,,"Reproductive Ecology and reproductive potential of Wild boar (Sus scrofa leukomyxtax) in Niigata Prefecture, a snowy area.","The number and spatial distribution of Japanese wild boars (Sus scrofa leucomystax) has increased remarkably in Japan [1] and their distribution is northward despite the heavy snow fall. To implement effective population control methods of Japanese wild boar it requires reliable information about reproductive ecology and reproductive performance. The aim of this study was to describe the seasonal reproductive pattern and reproductive potential (Ovulation rate (OR) and litter size (LS)) of wild boar population in Niigata prefecture as a snowy area with ~3m snow depth in winter. The study was based on findings from macroscopic examinations of the reproductive organs from 63 hunter-harvested female wild boars. Samples were collected in winter season (October – February) from 2015 to 2018. The age of the sampled animals was determined [2] and dressed weight was recorded. The stage of the reproductive cycle was defined according to ovarian and uterine findings. The crown-rump length (CRL) of the embryos/foetuses was used to calculate the oestrus/mating month and month for the expected farrowing.
Results revealed, 16 Animals (76 %) of 21 females, who are in age day 0 – 12 months, are already sexually matured. Further, 50% of these sexually matured animals are pregnant and all are in their age 4 – 8 months. 28 (62.2%) of the total sexually matured females (45) were gestating. 26 (93 %) of these gestating were in January and February. OR is the total number of active Corpus luteum (CL) from both ovaries. This is highly related with maternal body condition. According to the results, average CL number is 5±1.6SD with 1-9 range. The average number of foetuses/female (5.5±1.6SD) is increased from lighter and younger to heavier and older sows with 1-9 litter range.
Conception and birth periods differ significantly between the other areas of the country where snow falling is less or no. Birth synchronization was pronounced from February to May within a year, with a peak of births occurring in April which is nearly one month earlier than other areas of Japan."
15,12,Development of safe Al wild animal population management system,"In recent years, the problems such as personal injury and traffic accidents caused by animals appearing in the village area have been increasing. Furthermore, the destruction of local ecosystems by exotic organisms have also been a problem. In order to suppress such problems, we have to manage the animal population appropriately.
However, in Japan, the management of animal populations has become difficult due to the aging and rapidly decreasing of hunters who have high level skills to capture wild animals. Therefore, in this research, we aim to develop an unmanned, efficient and safe wild animal population management system with AI technology. In conventional traps, there was a problem of capturing non-target animals. On the other hand, with AI technology, the system can analyze the property of animals and capture the specific (target) animals and prevent capturing local (rare) animals.
The properties to be analyzed by proposed system are: • Species
Size (weight, length) Sex (female/male) Number (group, pair, single) Individual (detected on another place such as town or not)"
15,2,Application of empty fruit bunch produced from palm oil manufacturing process for Himalayan oyster mushroom cultivation ,"In Malaysia, palm oil is produced approximately 19 million ton per year, which is accounted for 33.5% in the world. During palm oil manufacturing process, wasted biomass is discharged approx. 38 million ton annually. Especially, discharged volume of the empty fruit bunch (EFB) causes several problems because burning of EFB was prohibited due to higher moisture content and dioxin production. Therefore, EFB has been piled up in the plantation areas since 1990’s. Recently, wasted EFB has contaminated in the plantation areas due to deterioration of mineral balance by higher potassium content of EFB. Therefore, effective utilization system of EFB is strongly required for stable industry development of palm oil. To overcome the problem, we focused on the high potassium content of EFB, which can be used for mushroom cultivation.
In this study, to effectively use the EFB for sustainable development, we evaluated the characteristics of EFB as a mushroom media material and cultivated Himalayan oyster mushroom using EFB. Comparative analysis of chemical characteristics indicated that EFB contains higher crude protein, ash, and nitrogen free extracts and lower crude fiber compared with sawdust. As a result of Himalayan oyster mushroom cultivation, we found that EFB has several positive effects for mushroom cultivation such as good aeration property, prevent of contamination, and facilitation of fruit body formation. The results suggested that the EFB can be one solution of mushroom cultivation farmers in Malaysia because contamination of mushroom media from other fungi and bacteria has frequently occurred."
15,9,Study on Construction of Regional Circulation System of Sewer Resources ,"
Kagoshima Prefecture’s crude tea production is the second largest (26,600 tons,2017) in Japan, accounting for 32% of the national share. Organic and compound fertilizers are used throughout the year in tea cultivation. The amount used is 50-70kgN / 10a per year, and costs 600,000 yen per ha per year. In recent years, the decline in gross profits due to sluggish tea prices and the increase in the prices of fertilizer and other production materials have put pressure on the management of tea farmers. Also, nationwide tea garden soils are increasing in available phosphate and potassium contents. Especially in Kagoshima Prefecture, the amount of potassium in the soil increases due to excessive application of cow manure compost, and inexpensive high nitrogen and low potassium fertilizers are required.
Based on this background, our research group focused on the component characteristics (high nitrogen and low potassium) of sewage sludge fertilizer that has not been established for local use, and examined its applicability to tea cultivation.
  (1) (2) (3)
As a result, the following knowledge was obtained.
Using sewage sludge fertilizer as an alternative to rapeseed oil cake increased the yield of tea leaves.
The quality and yield of tea leaves of ichibancha were good in the 25% and 50% sewage sludge fertilizers. The amount of heavy metals in tea leaves was low under the quality standard.
Since tea trees are perennial crops that prefer acidic soils, we will continue to conduct cultivation tests for several years to further examine the availability of sewage sludge fertilizer."
15,9,A study on the tensile performance of mortar using Moso bamboo fiber ,"Kagoshima Prefecture has the largest bamboo forest area in Japan. The majority of the bamboo forest area is occupied by Moso bamboo. It is a problem to induce the landslide disaster by the neglected bamboo forest.(Fig.1) Bamboo is used for power generation and paper making raw materials, but there is a need for an expansion of its use to solve the problem of neglected bamboo groves. In this study, we examined the applicability to concrete materials with the aim of effectively utilizing bamboo in the construction field where mass consumption is expected. Experiments were conducted on the tensile performance of mortar by changing the amount of mixing of bamboo fibers.(Photo.1) Tensile test for mortar was carried out in accordance with JIS A 1113. (Photo.2) This study revealed the effect of the amount of mixing of bamboo fibers on the improvement of tensile toughness performance of mortar."
15,13,"UTILIZATION OF OYSTER SHELL
FOR GREENING POROUS CONCRETE AGGREGATE","The oyster shells of about 100,000 tons are annually produced as a by-product in Hiroshima Prefecture (Photo1). One of the solutions is the development of oyster shell porous concrete (Oy-PoC). The compressive strength of Oy-PoC was lower than that of normal crushed stone porous concrete (N-PoC). On the contrary, Oy-PoC has significantly high water retentivity compared with N-PoC because of oyster shell aggregate with high water absorption. In previous researches, it was found that Oy-PoC with finely crushed oyster shell had high plant- growing performance. However, all of the planting test periods were less than three months, and long-term tests have not been conducted yet. In this study, the plant-growing performance of Oy-PoC was investigated by a long- term planting test over one year.
Oy-PoC and hybrid porous concrete (Hy-PoC), which was combined with Oy-PoC and N-PoC, were prepared for the planting test. Figure1 shows the schematic diagram of planting test. The grass length and the green coverage level with mesh method were employed to estimate the plant-growing performance in this study. From the test results, the plant-growing performance of Oy-PoC was higher than that of Hy-PoC because Oy-PoC had much higher oyster shell aggregate than Hy-PoC. The green coverage level could estimate the plant-growing performance of porous concrete properly compared with the grass length."
15,9,Development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can be operated over a long distance using wireless communication ,"We are developing a UAV, and the purpose of this study is to perform safe takeoff and landing of the UAV. We need to develop the necessary technology to use the runway in any weather condition. We have conducted several challenges of the running test in Mongolia, but we now need to test the runway conditions that satisfy the present UAV specification. We conducted experiments indoors in winter, as well as a model test (simulation test) in the room. The indoor test yielded a stability analysis of takeoff and landing.
We implemented a taxiing test both indoors and outdoors and found a first person view camera (FPV) effective and that a rolling bench testing method can evaluate the taxiing stability for heavy UAVs. 1) Laboratory experiments were quite effective for checking the UAV before implementing the field test. We found the roller machine could evaluate the stability of the UAV quite well during taxiing by measuring vibration. 2) FPV can make safe taxiing possible. However, the images were sometimes missing during operation both for experiments run on the floor and for transmission experiments. Therefore, we need to use two or more cameras in different telemetry frequencies for safety. 3) The UAV60 had a serious drifting wheel problem, but the UAV40 demonstrated excellent taxiing. 4) The four wheel system was very stable on the bumpy concrete floor. 5) Surveying the unpaved runaway, we found a roughness of 20% (variation/wheel diameter), so our foam model planes were not suitable, and we decided to use indoor experiments. 6) We conducted indoor rolling bench tests more than 15 times, and since one field test costs more than 100USD, the rolling bench test, as well as the FPV tests, significantly reduced the testing costs and time."
15,14,Biosynthesis and Characterization of Bacterial Nanocellulose under Dynamic Condition Using High-Speed Rotor Reactor,"
Bacterial nanocellulose (BC) is bio-cellulosic polymers synthesized by gram-negative bacteria such as Acetobacter xylinum and Komagataeibacter xylinum. BC has attracted many researchers because of their unique properties having ultra-fine nanofiber network and high biocompatibility without additional purification using chemicals. Due to the sustainability issue, it is expected that biopolymer can replace industrial plastics. Biosynthesis process in static and dynamic conditions enables BC production and different properties of resultant products. For dynamic condition to yield nanocellulose fiber suspension, agitation impeller was used during the biosynthesis [1]. However, there was no report on high-speed rotor reactor to produce BC. The high-speed rotor technology has been often applied for mixing high viscous materials like resin because of the high turbulent shear rate made by rotation and revolution [2]. Based on this point of view, the objective of present research is to use high-speed rotor reactor in biosynthesis of BC.
Three BC cultivation conditions of static condition, orbital shaking and high-speed rotary mixing were compared. From SEM image (Fig.1), BC obtained from high-speed rotary mixing condition demonstrated nano fiber network with diameter approximately 50 nm. XRD patterns in Fig.2 showed crystalline structure of the BC obtained from each culture conditions. The diffraction peaks appeared in 14.3°,16.8°,22.5°indicated (110), (110), and (200) planes of cellulose, respectively. In conclusion, BC could be synthesized under high-speed rotary mixing and possibly be applied for reinforcement material due to the high crystallinity of about 80%."
16,5,Application of DHS reactor as Low-cost Water Purification System in East Africa ,"Access to safe drinking water and sanitation is one of the big remained global issue for sustainable development. The WHO/UNISEF reported 2.2 billion people lack access to safety managed drinking water services and 4.2 billion people lack safety managed sanitation serves [1]. A down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor used sponge as biomass retained carrier developed as low-cost sewage treatment system for developing countries. Our research group demonstrated high treatment performance of DHS reactor in India, Egypt and Thailand [2].
In this study, we applied DHS reactor for water purification process in Kennya to develop low-cost water purification system. In order to design the process, water quality of river for water source in Thika City, Kennya was surveyed. The high COD and BOD concentrations of 47 mg/L and 15.5 mg/L indicated that the water source for DHS reactor was highly polluted and need to remove organic to meet the standard for drinking water. Moreover, large amount of nitrite was detected in the river. Figure 1 shows the design of DHS system for water purification. The system is consisted by a sedimentation tank for removing large particular, a DHS reactor for removing organic compounds and nitrogen, a sand filter for finishing process and a reserved tank. The designed water purification volume was 1,700 L/day. For future study, the water quality of the proposed system is investigated and optimized to the local situation."
16,17,A New Science Communication for Stimulating Imagination and Creativity -for Infinite Possibilities- ,"It is said a boom of science communication begins in Japan in 2005[1]. The boom was born because science deeply through society, concerns and anxiety have spread to the general public. For this reason, bi-directional and multi-directional science communication is required for citizens to learn and think about the science they need while enjoying[2]. On the other hand, a decline in students positive attitude toward science is a serious problem. So, a new kind of style of science communication that children can enjoy manufacturing and stimulate their imagination and creativity are needed.
From these backgrounds, we held a robot contest cooperate with VIVITA Japan, Nagaoka Youth Employment Organization, and Nagaoka University of Technology as technical support. To attend this contest, 11 elementary students in Nagaoka city experienced robot design, prototyping and programming using a laser cutting machine and software developed by VIVITA without helping from supporters from July.
In the contest in September in Nagaoka, they competed for points decided by collected balls on the field. Five students who win the contest participated in the final contest in Tokyo in October. Children enjoyed manufacturing with showed off their imagination and creativity. And they also felt the difficulty of manufacturing. Supporters could learn the infinite possibilities from children.
This bi-directional science communication by robot contest generated new discoveries not only for children but also for supporters."
17,11,Study on Classification of Small Base Formation Project by Laud Use Control ,"
The population is dwindling in japan. The formation of “Small Base” in Japan is promoted by the Japanese government to sustainable village in remote place. On the other hand, the formation of “Compact City” to sustainable principal city function is promoted by the Japanese government too. These and “Small Base” that development in out of City Planning Area conduct are looks like opposition each other. In this research focusing on relationship between facility for making the “Small Base” and land use control.
In this research, focusing on 1390 projects to form “Small Base”. 945 projects was able to identify the location of the facility from the plan. Making groups according to the relationship with project and 5 types land use control.
There are many project (742/945) in areas where land use control are week. In this area，there is a risk of building disordered manifold facilities around facility. As a result, areas that are difficult to live in may be formed.Therefore, consideration is necessary in not only the project location but also the surrounding area.
There are many project in areas where land use control are strong. For example, Ukiha city, Fukuoka Prefecture make a facility named Ukihako for base of a group that plans and sells tourism products. It's doubtful whether the surrounding environment suitable for forming a base. It’s in out of City Planning Area and Agricultural Zones. There are possibility that urbanization will occur, however not only bad project but also project to keep minimum required functions to save the village.
In the future, we will clarify how the measures of urban planning of municipalities relate to projects, by analyzing how it is reflected in the comprehensive plan and city planning master plan of each local government from its positioning and consistency."
